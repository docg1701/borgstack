# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Deliver a technically viable, pre-integrated stack of 13 open source tools that work together as a unified system deployable in 4-6 hours
- Provide Brazilian companies with a zero-license-cost alternative to proprietary automation platforms with complete data sovereignty
- Eliminate vendor lock-in while providing enterprise-grade workflow automation, omnichannel customer service, application builder, and media processing capabilities
- Achieve 90%+ successful deployment rate with significant cost reduction compared to proprietary tools
- Build a technically sound open source project with comprehensive documentation and community support

## Background Context
BorgStack addresses the need for a cost-effective automation solution for Portuguese-speaking businesses seeking alternatives to proprietary SaaS tools. While many companies use automation platforms, the high costs of proprietary solutions and concerns about data residency create opportunities for open source alternatives. Current approaches require significant technical expertise to integrate multiple tools, creating barriers for smaller organizations. BorgStack provides a pre-integrated stack with Portuguese documentation, focusing on technical viability rather than market size claims.
