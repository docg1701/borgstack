# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
This PRD outlines the complete BorgStack automation stack. Please review the user experience requirements, particularly focusing on the Lowcoder login interface implementation and Portuguese documentation needs.

## Architect Prompt
Please review the technical architecture for BorgStack, focusing on the Docker Compose configuration, internal networking, and integration requirements between all 13 components. Pay special attention to database isolation strategy (PostgreSQL for SQL apps, MongoDB for Lowcoder), Redis sharing, and service communication patterns.
