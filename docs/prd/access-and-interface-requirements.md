# Access and Interface Requirements

## System Access Model
The system provides individual access to each component through their native web interfaces, with no centralized UI or unified dashboard. Users access each tool directly via browser through Caddy reverse proxy routing.

## Component Access
- **Direct Access**: Each component (n8n, Chatwoot, Lowcoder, Directus, etc.) is accessed through its own URL
- **Individual Authentication**: Each service maintains its own login system and user management
- **Native Interfaces**: Users interact with each tool's standard web interface
- **No Custom UI**: BorgStack does not include custom user interfaces beyond the components themselves

## Administrative Access
- **Command Line**: All system operations performed via Docker commands and scripts
- **Configuration Files**: Manual configuration through environment variables and config files
- **Log Access**: Direct access to container logs for troubleshooting
- **Database Management**: Direct database access for administrative tasks
