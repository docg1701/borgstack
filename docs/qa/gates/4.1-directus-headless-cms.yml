  GATE DECISION CHANGE: CONCERNS → PASS

  The developer has successfully resolved all critical issues from the previous review.
  The addition of 6 automated API tests provides comprehensive validation of the previously
  unvalidated acceptance criteria (AC4 and AC5).

  Quality improvements:
  - Requirements traceability: 67% → 100% automated coverage
  - Test suite size: 20 → 26 tests (+30% coverage)
  - Quality score: 90/100 → 95/100 (+5 points)
  - Reliability NFR: CONCERNS → PASS (upgraded 2 levels)

  The implementation demonstrates professional-grade test architecture with:
  - Proper authentication flow (login → extract token → use token → cleanup)
  - Test data uniqueness (timestamp-based collection names)
  - Dependency management (graceful skip when dependencies fail)
  - Resource cleanup (test collection deletion)
  - Security best practices (credentials from environment variables)

  All blocking issues are resolved. Manual testing remains optional for documentation
  completeness but is no longer required for story completion.

  RECOMMENDATION: Story owner can confidently mark this story as Done. All critical
  validation is automated, and production deployment is approved from a quality perspective.
