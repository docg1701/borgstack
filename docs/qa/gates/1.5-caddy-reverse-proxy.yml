  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "CORS wildcard origins configured for Evolution API and Directus (RESOLVED)"
    impact: "Originally allowed requests from any origin. Now configurable via environment variable."

    status: resolved
    resolved_at: "2025-10-02T00:00:00Z"
    resolution: "Implemented CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable across Caddyfile, docker-compose.yml, and .env.example with security warnings and production examples"

  - id: "SEC-002"
    severity: low
    finding: "Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header not implemented"
    impact: "Additional security layer missing, though noted as complex due to 'unsafe-inline' requirements"

    suggested_action: "Consider implementing service-specific CSP headers in future production hardening story"
    suggested_owner: dev
    status: deferred
    deferred_reason: "Acceptable for MVP - complex implementation due to 'unsafe-inline' requirements. Defer to future production hardening epic."
