# Quality Gate Decision - Story 1.6: Bootstrap Script Development
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect) - 2025-10-02

schema: 1
story: "1.6"
story_title: "Bootstrap Script Development (Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure)"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Excellent implementation with 90/100 quality score. Three non-critical concerns identified: CORS wildcard default, health check retry logic, and DNS verification workflow. All are acceptable for MVP but should be addressed before production deployment."

top_issues:
  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS defaults to wildcard '*' in bootstrap.sh line 419"
    impact: "Potential security risk if user deploys to production without changing"
    files: ["scripts/bootstrap.sh:419", ".env.example:138"]
    suggested_action: "Consider prompting user during bootstrap for CORS configuration, or display more prominent warning about production requirements"
    suggested_owner: "dev"
    status: "Documented with warnings - acceptable for MVP"

  - id: "REL-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Health checks run once after 60s wait with no retry logic (bootstrap.sh:514-573)"
    impact: "May fail on slower systems or busy servers during initial deployment"
    files: ["scripts/bootstrap.sh:514-573"]
    suggested_action: "Add retry loop (3-5 attempts with 10s intervals) for health check validation"
    suggested_owner: "dev"
    status: "Current approach acceptable but could be more robust"

  - id: "UX-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "DNS verification is optional, script only displays instructions without validation"
    impact: "User may deploy without DNS configured, causing SSL certificate generation to fail"
    files: ["scripts/bootstrap.sh:579-649"]
    suggested_action: "Consider optional DNS verification step with skip option to improve user experience"
    suggested_owner: "dev"
    status: "Acceptable for MVP - users can manually verify"
