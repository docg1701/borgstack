nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Network isolation correct (borgstack_internal), credentials in .env.example, no hardcoded secrets. All security requirements met."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Performance benchmarks explicitly deferred per AC 5 (acceptable). SeaweedFS and Filer API operational with good response times."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All 12 integration tests passing, monitoring script operational, CI/CD validation complete. Automated regression prevention in place."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation quality. Solution pivot well-researched and justified. Clear architecture decision. Test suite maintainable."

strengths:
  - "Comprehensive integration test suite: 12/12 tests passing, excellent coverage"
  - "Storage monitoring script operational with proper alert thresholds (70%/85%)"
  - "Complete CI/CD validation job with 9+ configuration checks"
  - "All containers healthy: 14/14 services operational"
  - "Excellent architecture decision: Filer HTTP API pivot well-researched"
  - "High-quality bilingual documentation with practical examples"
  - "Proper security practices: network isolation, credential management"
  - "Solution maintains 100% free/open-source commitment"
  - "Automated regression prevention now in place"
