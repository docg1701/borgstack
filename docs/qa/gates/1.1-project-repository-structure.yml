# Detailed Findings
review_notes: |
  This story establishes the foundational structure for BorgStack with exceptional quality:

  **Strengths:**
  - Complete directory structure matching architecture specification exactly
  - Comprehensive .env.example with excellent security documentation
  - Bilingual README (EN/PT-BR) with clear instructions
  - Robust CI workflow with multiple validation checks
  - Proper Docker Compose file separation (base, override, prod)
  - Excellent .gitignore configuration with clear sections
  - MIT License properly included

  **Acceptance Criteria Validation:**
  1. ✅ Monorepo structure - All directories from source-tree.md created
  2. ✅ docker-compose.yml centerpiece - Present with proper networks
  3. ✅ Separate directories - config/, docs/, scripts/, tests/ all exist
  4. ✅ .gitignore for Docker - Comprehensive with all required exclusions
  5. ✅ .env.example template - All variables with security warnings
  6. ✅ .env exclusion - Properly configured in .gitignore
  7. ✅ README.md - Bilingual, comprehensive, professional quality
  8. ✅ Version control - Branching strategy documented, CI configured

  **Compliance Check:**
  - Coding Standards: ✅ All naming conventions followed
  - Project Structure: ✅ Matches source-tree.md exactly
  - Testing Strategy: ✅ Appropriate validation approach
  - Docker Best Practices: ✅ Network isolation, no latest tags

  **Code Quality:** Exemplary for infrastructure configuration
  **Documentation Quality:** Outstanding - bilingual, comprehensive
  **Test Coverage:** Appropriate for infrastructure validation

  No refactoring or improvements needed. Ready for production use.
