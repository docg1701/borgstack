  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Network isolation correctly implemented (internal network only, no port exposure). Least privilege access model with separate users per service. Encrypted passwords via environment variables. No hardcoded secrets."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Memory configuration optimized for 36GB RAM server (shared_buffers=8GB, effective_cache_size=24GB). Connection pooling supported (max_connections=200). SSD-optimized settings (random_page_cost=1.1)."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Health checks implemented with proper intervals and retries. restart: unless-stopped policy ensures automatic recovery. Persistent volume ensures data durability. Backup strategy documented. Data persistence verified in tests."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Exceptional inline documentation in all configuration files. Configuration as code enables tracking and rollback. Comprehensive test suite for regression prevention. Version pinning ensures reproducible deployments."

# Review summary
summary: |
  Story 1.3 demonstrates exemplary implementation quality across all deliverables.

  The PostgreSQL database setup is production-ready with:
  - Comprehensive documentation (inline comments explaining every decision)
  - Robust security configuration (network isolation, least privilege)
  - Thorough test coverage (10 tests covering all 9 ACs)
  - Performance optimization (tuned for 36GB RAM with SSD optimization)
  - Complete reliability features (health checks, persistence, backup strategy)

  All 9 acceptance criteria are fully implemented and verified through automated tests.
  No refactoring was necessary - all code meets or exceeds quality standards.

  This implementation serves as an excellent foundation for future database-dependent
  services (Stories 2.1-4.2) and demonstrates strong engineering practices that should
  be replicated in future stories.

  GATE DECISION: PASS with 100/100 quality score.
  Ready for production deployment immediately.
