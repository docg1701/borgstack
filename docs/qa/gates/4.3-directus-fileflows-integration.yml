  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "HMAC webhook signature validation implemented. API token scoped to minimum permissions (directus_files read/update only). HTTPS enforced correctly."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Monitoring workflow included. Performance metrics documented. Queue management strategy defined."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling. Missed Files Detector workflow provides automatic retry for webhook delivery failures. Robust recovery mechanisms."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation. Clear configuration guides. Well-structured workflows. Manual tasks clearly documented with realistic time estimates."

strengths:
  - "Comprehensive integration documentation with architecture diagrams and sequence flows"
  - "Well-structured n8n workflows with clear separation of concerns"
  - "Detailed manual task documentation with realistic time estimates (~100 min total)"
  - "Bilingual configuration guides (Portuguese) with step-by-step instructions"
  - "Error handling workflows with categorization logic"
  - "Proactive performance monitoring (15-min intervals) + automatic retry (30-min intervals)"
  - "Test script comprehensive with 10 test cases covering all acceptance criteria"
  - "Storage optimization strategy documented with retention policies"
  - "All acceptance criteria have corresponding test coverage"
  - "Coding standards compliance verified (volume naming, network isolation, config as code)"
  - "Security best practices: HMAC validation, scoped permissions, HTTPS enforcement"
  - "Reliability improvements: automatic retry mechanism, graceful error handling"

deployment_readiness:
  - "✅ All 6 acceptance criteria implemented and tested"
  - "✅ Security gaps closed (HMAC validation, scoped API token)"
  - "✅ Reliability improved (Missed Files Detector automatic retry)"
  - "✅ Documentation complete (integration guide, config guides, troubleshooting)"
  - "✅ Manual deployment tasks documented (~100 min, 9 tasks)"
  - "✅ No blocking issues remaining"

deployment_risk: LOW

estimated_deployment_time: "~1.7 hours for manual configuration (Tasks 1-9)"
