story: "2.2"
story_title: "Evolution API Integration"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All 7 acceptance criteria validated and passing. WhatsApp integration production-ready with comprehensive security (API key auth, DB isolation, network security). Test coverage 100% (20 total tests). Multi-instance support validated. Webhook integration with n8n fully documented and tested. Minor webhook auth limitation documented (Evolution API v2.2.3 constraint). Zero blocking issues."

top_issues:
  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Evolution API v2.2.3 does not support webhook authentication - webhooks are delivered without authentication headers"
    suggested_action: "DOCUMENTED - Added security note in config/evolution/README.md (lines 258, 562-564). Consider implementing webhook signature validation in n8n workflow if sensitive data is transmitted. Acceptable for MVP as webhook endpoint is HTTPS-only."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "EXCELLENT - Multi-layered security: API key authentication (EVOLUTION_API_KEY 32-char), database password (32-char), network isolation (borgstack_internal for DB/Redis, no port exposure), HTTPS enforcement via Caddy, secure credential storage (.env 600 permissions + .gitignore). Webhook auth limitation documented as Evolution API v2.2.3 constraint."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Health check intervals appropriate (30s/10s/5/60s for Prisma migrations), dependency ordering with service_healthy, Redis session caching, PostgreSQL connection pooling via Prisma ORM, asynchronous webhook delivery (non-blocking)"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Restart policy unless-stopped, health check with 5 retries, proper dependency management (PostgreSQL + Redis service_healthy), persistent volume for WhatsApp session data (borgstack_evolution_instances), backup strategy documented"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "EXCELLENT - Comprehensive documentation (650+ lines across 3 guides: WhatsApp setup, n8n integration, troubleshooting), 5 common issues with solutions, example workflows, API payload examples, CI integration (12 automated validation checks), production deployment checklist"
