nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'EXCELLENT - 7/7 security controls implemented: authentication (root admin + lowcoder_user), RBAC (least privilege enforced), network isolation (borgstack_internal only, no port exposure), strong password generation (32-char alphanumeric), .env security (600 permissions, .gitignore), configuration security (read-only mount), secret storage (.env template only)'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'MongoDB 7.0 (latest stable), dedicated NoSQL storage for Lowcoder (no schema conflicts), independent scaling capability, appropriate for document-based metadata workload'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Health check (mongosh ping every 10s, 5 retries, 30s start period), restart policy (unless-stopped), persistent volume (borgstack_mongodb_data), automatic initialization script, backup strategy documented'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'EXCELLENT - Comprehensive documentation (docker-compose.yml: 56 lines, init-mongo.js: 21 lines), configuration as code (version-controlled init script), clear naming, 15 validation tests, backup procedures documented, troubleshooting support'
