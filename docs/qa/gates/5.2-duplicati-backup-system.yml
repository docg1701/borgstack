  project_structure: PASS
  notes: |
    ✅ Config files in config/duplicati/
    ✅ Documentation in docs/03-services/ and docs/04-integrations/
    ✅ Scripts in scripts/
    ✅ Tests in tests/deployment/
    ✅ All paths follow unified-project-structure.md

  testing_strategy: PASS
  notes: |
    ✅ Deployment validation focus (not unit tests - pre-built image)
    ✅ 12 comprehensive test cases in verify-duplicati.sh
    ✅ CI integration with static validation
    ✅ Manual test procedures clearly documented
    ✅ Tests cover all 8 acceptance criteria

notes: |
  Exceptional implementation quality. This story demonstrates:

  1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: 3 detailed Portuguese documents totaling 2,107 lines
  2. **Robust Testing**: 12-test verification script + 11-step CI validation
  3. **Security Excellence**: Multiple layers (encryption, no port exposure, read-only mounts, strict headers)
  4. **Operational Readiness**: Automation scripts, templates, troubleshooting guides
  5. **Standards Compliance**: Perfect adherence to coding standards and project structure

  The manual verification steps are EXPECTED and PROPER for a backup system - you cannot
  fully test backup/restore without actual execution. All manual steps are clearly documented
  with step-by-step procedures, estimated times, and validation criteria.

  The implementation provides a production-ready backup system that:
  - Protects all critical BorgStack data
  - Provides disaster recovery capabilities
  - Maintains Brazilian data sovereignty options
  - Includes comprehensive operational procedures

  RECOMMENDATION: Approve for Done status. Execute manual verification checklist during
  deployment to production environment.
