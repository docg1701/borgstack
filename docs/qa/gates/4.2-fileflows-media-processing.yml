    ac_covered: [1, 2, 3, 4]
    ac_gaps: [5, 6]  # AC5 and AC6 require manual UI configuration during deployment (documented in Tasks 12-13)

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No port exposure to host, network isolation enforced (borgstack_internal/external), HTTPS via Caddy, file permissions managed with PUID/PGID, security headers configured"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Health check timeout appropriate (60s start_period), concurrent processing configurable, long-running request timeout (3600s), temp directory for scratch space"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Restart policy: unless-stopped, health check implemented, dependency management (depends_on caddy), comprehensive error handling, troubleshooting documentation"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation (technical README, Portuguese user guide, example flows), configuration as code, S3 migration plan documented, consistent naming conventions, version pinning"

compliance_check:
  coding_standards: PASS
  testing_strategy: PASS
  documentation: PASS

strengths:
  - "Comprehensive implementation following all BorgStack coding standards (version pinning, volume naming, network isolation, health checks)"
  - "Excellent documentation: Technical README + Portuguese user guide + example flows with FFmpeg command explanations"
  - "Thorough automated testing: 12 deployment validation tests covering container status, volumes, networks, Caddy routing, HTTPS"
  - "Future-proof planning: S3 migration template (s3-storage.env.example) prepared for Story 5.1 SeaweedFS integration"
  - "Clear integration patterns with Directus and n8n documented"
  - "Consistent with existing service implementations (Directus, Lowcoder)"
  - "Security best practices: No port exposure, network isolation, HTTPS enforcement, security headers"
  - "Well-structured configuration management with comprehensive inline documentation"

concerns: []

notes:
  - "Story status is 'Approved' rather than 'Review' but proceeding with QA review as requested"
  - "Tasks 12-13 are correctly marked as pending manual execution during deployment - this is appropriate as media processing cannot be automated without actual deployment and test media files"
  - "AC5 (processing nodes and libraries initialized) requires manual UI configuration - this is inherent to FileFlows design and documented clearly"
  - "AC6 (basic media conversion flows tested) pending deployment - test script is ready and executable"
  - "Local volume storage is temporary technical debt with clear migration path to SeaweedFS S3 in Story 5.1"
  - "All configuration files validated: docker-compose.yml, .env.example, Caddyfile, verify-fileflows.sh, README.md, s3-storage.env.example, example-flows.json, fileflows.md"
  - "No refactoring needed - all code follows established patterns and standards"
