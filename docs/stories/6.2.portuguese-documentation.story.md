## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 6.1 (Integration Testing Suite):**
[Source: docs/stories/6.1.integration-testing-suite.story.md#dev-agent-record]

- **Documentation Best Practice**: Story 6.1 created comprehensive `tests/README.md` with 390 lines covering test execution, troubleshooting, contribution guidelines, and best practices. This demonstrates the level of detail expected for user-facing documentation.
- **Test Coverage Matrix Pattern**: Component × Test Type grid proved valuable for understanding system coverage. Similar documentation matrix could be useful (Component × Documentation Type).
- **Known Limitations Documentation**: Explicitly documenting limitations and manual configuration requirements (19 manual-config tests skipped) increased user confidence. Portuguese docs should similarly document known limitations and post-MVP features.
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Integration test docs use Mermaid extensively for architecture visualization. Portuguese docs should leverage this for workflow illustrations.
- **Troubleshooting Structure**: Integration tests documented failure scenarios with clear cause → solution mappings. Troubleshooting guide (Task 5) should follow this pattern.

### Core Workflows Context

**Four Main Integration Workflows to Document:**
[Source: docs/architecture/core-workflows.md]

**Workflow 1: WhatsApp → Chatwoot Customer Service Integration**
- Components: Customer → WhatsApp (Meta) → Evolution API → n8n → Chatwoot → PostgreSQL → Redis
- Key integration points: Webhook triggers, bi-directional sync, async communication via Redis
- Error scenarios: API 500 errors, race conditions, webhook delivery failures, rate limits, Redis connection loss
- **Documentation required**: Integration guide (docs/04-integrations/whatsapp-chatwoot.md)

**Workflow 2: Initial Deployment and Bootstrap**
- Steps: System prep → Docker install → .env generation → DNS validation → Image pull → Service startup → SSL generation → Health checks
- Total time: 4-6 hours (NFR1 requirement)
- **Documentation required**: Installation guide (docs/01-instalacao.md)

**Workflow 3: Automated Backup Process**
- Components: PostgreSQL dumps (4 databases) → MongoDB dump → Volume snapshots → Duplicati compression/encryption → External storage
- Retention: 7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly, 5 yearly
- Estimated size: ~50GB full backup
- **Documentation required**: Maintenance guide backup section (docs/06-manutencao.md)

**Workflow 4: Media File Processing Pipeline**
- Components: User → Directus (upload) → n8n (webhook) → FileFlows (FFmpeg processing) → n8n (completion webhook) → Directus (update)
- Processing: Format detection (FFprobe) → Transcoding (FFmpeg: libx264, AAC) → Output
- **Documentation required**: Integration guide (docs/04-integrations/directus-fileflows.md - already exists)

### System Requirements Context

**Hardware and Software Requirements:**
[Source: docs/architecture/deployment-architecture.md, README.md]

**Minimum Requirements:**
- OS: Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS (long-term support until 2029)
- CPU: 8 vCPU cores minimum (for 14 concurrent containers)
- RAM: 36 GB minimum (16GB absolute minimum, 36GB recommended for production)
- Storage: 500 GB SSD recommended (minimum 200GB)
- Network: Public IP, ports 80/443/22 accessible, DNS A records for all service domains

**Software Dependencies:**
- Docker Engine (latest stable, installed by bootstrap script)
- Docker Compose v2 plugin (installed by bootstrap script)
- Git (for cloning repository)
- UFW firewall (configured by bootstrap script: allow 22/80/443, deny all others)
- System utilities: curl, wget, dig, htop, sysstat (installed by bootstrap script)

**Deployment Checklist:**
[Source: docs/architecture/deployment-architecture.md#deployment-checklist]
- Pre-deployment: Server provisioned, DNS configured, firewall configured, SSH keys, non-root user with docker group, backup destination configured
- Deployment: Clone repo, run bootstrap or manual install, pull images, generate .env, start services, verify SSL, check health
- Post-deployment: Access each service UI, configure admin accounts, set up first workflow, configure backups, test restore, document credentials, configure monitoring, security review, user training

### Security Context

**Security Requirements to Document:**
[Source: docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md]

**Network Security:**
- UFW firewall: default deny incoming, allow 22/80/443
- Docker network isolation: `borgstack_internal` (service-to-service, not exposed to host), `borgstack_external` (Caddy only, public-facing)
- Database ports NEVER exposed to host in production (5432, 27017, 6379, 8333)

**Data Security:**
- **Mandatory (MVP)**: Duplicati AES-256 backup encryption, .env file chmod 600
- **Recommended (Production)**: PostgreSQL pgcrypto for sensitive columns, LUKS full disk encryption, Redis persistence on encrypted volume
- **Key Management**: Development uses .env (600 permissions), production should use HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
- **Rotation Policy**: Rotate encryption keys every 90 days

**Authentication Security:**
- JWTs in httpOnly cookies (Chatwoot, Directus)
- Session tokens in Redis with expiration (default 7 days)
- API keys encrypted in PostgreSQL (n8n credentials)
- Password policy: minimum 12 characters, mixed case/numbers/symbols, bcrypt hashing

**Application Security:**
- CSP headers via Caddy for all services
- XSS prevention: X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
- CORS policy configured per service in Caddyfile
- Rate limiting at application level (n8n, Chatwoot, Evolution API)
- Input validation by each service (Rails validators, Express middleware)

### Performance Context

**Performance Targets and Optimization:**
[Source: docs/architecture/security-and-performance.md, docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Performance Baselines (36GB RAM, 8 vCPU Server):**

| Metric | Target (p95) | Acceptable (p99) | Critical Threshold |
|--------|--------------|------------------|--------------------|
| API Response Time | < 200ms | < 500ms | > 1000ms |
| Webhook Throughput | 100 req/s | 50 req/s | < 25 req/s |
| Database Connections | < 150 concurrent | < 180 concurrent | > 200 (pool exhausted) |
| Redis Operations | > 10,000 ops/s | > 5,000 ops/s | < 1,000 ops/s |
| Disk I/O (SSD) | > 100 MB/s | > 50 MB/s | < 20 MB/s |
| Memory Usage | < 75% | < 85% | > 90% (swap risk) |
| CPU Usage | < 70% avg | < 85% avg | > 95% sustained |

**PostgreSQL Tuning (36GB RAM server):**
```conf
shared_buffers = 8GB
effective_cache_size = 24GB
maintenance_work_mem = 2GB
max_connections = 200
work_mem = 20MB
random_page_cost = 1.1  # SSD optimization
```

**Redis Caching Strategy:**
- n8n: Workflow definitions cached (TTL 300s)
- Chatwoot: Conversation metadata cached (TTL 600s)
- Directus: Collection schemas cached (TTL 3600s)
- Lowcoder: Application definitions cached (TTL 1800s)
- Cache hit ratio target: > 80%

### Troubleshooting Context

**Common Issues from Integration Tests:**
[Source: docs/stories/6.1.integration-testing-suite.story.md, tests/README.md]

**Known Limitations (from Story 6.1):**
- 19 manual-config tests require user setup (WhatsApp QR scan, n8n workflow import, Chatwoot inbox creation, API tokens)
- 2 destructive tests skipped in CI (disk space exhaustion, invalid config)

**Failure Scenarios Tested:**
1. Database connection loss (PostgreSQL stop/restart, services reconnect automatically)
2. Redis connection loss (Redis stop/restart, services reconnect, queued jobs resume)
3. Network partition (n8n isolation/reconnection, recovery within 30-60s)
4. Service restart under load (n8n restart, in-flight requests fail gracefully, recovery within 30s)

**Common Test Failures:**
- Container not healthy: Check logs with `docker compose logs <service>`, verify env vars, check dependencies
- Network connectivity: Verify services on correct networks, use `docker compose exec <service> ping <target>`
- SSL certificate failures: Check DNS propagation with `dig <domain>`, verify ports 80/443 accessible
- Integration failures: Verify webhooks configured, check API keys, review n8n execution logs

### Coding Standards Context

**Documentation Naming Conventions:**
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Documentation Files:**
- Format: Numbered, kebab-case.md (e.g., `01-instalacao.md`, `02-configuracao.md`)
- Rationale: Sequential reading order, language-specific
- Service guides: kebab-case.md (e.g., `n8n.md`, `evolution-api.md`)
- Integration guides: kebab-case.md describing integration (e.g., `whatsapp-chatwoot.md`)

**Portuguese Translation Guidelines:**
- Technical terms: Use Portuguese where natural (e.g., "configuração", "instalação"), keep English for proper nouns (PostgreSQL, n8n, Docker)
- Commands: Keep command syntax in English (e.g., `docker compose up -d`), explain in Portuguese
- Examples: Use Brazilian context where applicable (e.g., LGPD compliance, Brazilian domains .com.br)

**Markdown Best Practices:**
- Use proper heading hierarchy (# for title, ## for sections, ### for subsections)
- Code blocks must specify language (```bash, ```yaml, ```json)
- Use Mermaid for diagrams (```mermaid)
- Use tables for structured data
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps, bullet lists for non-sequential items
- Use blockquotes for important notes: `> **Note:** Important information`

### Mermaid Diagram Examples

**Example 1: Sequence Diagram (for Integration Guides)**
Use this pattern for workflow integrations like WhatsApp → Chatwoot:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Customer
    participant WhatsApp
    participant Evolution
    participant n8n
    participant Chatwoot
    participant PostgreSQL

    Customer->>WhatsApp: Send message
    WhatsApp->>Evolution: Webhook delivery
    Evolution->>n8n: POST /webhook/whatsapp-incoming
    n8n->>PostgreSQL: Query customer data
    PostgreSQL-->>n8n: Customer record
    n8n->>Chatwoot: Create conversation
    Chatwoot-->>n8n: Conversation created
    n8n->>Chatwoot: Add message to inbox
    Chatwoot-->>n8n: Message added
```

**Example 2: Flowchart (for Installation/Configuration Workflows)**
Use this pattern for step-by-step processes:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start: Bootstrap Script] --> B{Check OS}
    B -->|Ubuntu 24.04| C[Check RAM]
    B -->|Other OS| Z[Error: Wrong OS]
    C -->|>= 16GB| D[Install Docker]
    C -->|< 16GB| Z
    D --> E[Configure UFW]
    E --> F[Generate .env]
    F --> G[Pull Images]
    G --> H[Start Services]
    H --> I{All Healthy?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Success]
    I -->|No| K[Show Logs]
```

**Example 3: Network Architecture Diagram**
Use this pattern for network topology documentation:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Internet"
        User[User Browser]
    end

    subgraph "borgstack_external"
        Caddy[Caddy<br/>Reverse Proxy]
    end

    subgraph "borgstack_internal"
        N8N[n8n]
        Chatwoot[Chatwoot]
        Directus[Directus]
        Evolution[Evolution API]
        PostgreSQL[(PostgreSQL)]
        Redis[(Redis)]
        MongoDB[(MongoDB)]
    end

    User -->|HTTPS| Caddy
    Caddy -->|HTTP| N8N
    Caddy -->|HTTP| Chatwoot
    Caddy -->|HTTP| Directus
    N8N --> PostgreSQL
    Chatwoot --> PostgreSQL
    Chatwoot --> Redis
    N8N --> Redis
    Evolution --> MongoDB
```

**Sourcing Diagram Content:**
- Use architecture documents for technical accuracy
- Reference existing integration guides for workflow patterns
- Use docker-compose.yml for network and service relationships
- Consult tests/README.md for error handling flows

## Testing

### Test Requirements

**Documentation Quality Validation:**
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md, Story 6.2 requirements]

**No Unit Tests Required:**
- Documentation is not code, doesn't require automated tests
- Focus on manual review and validation

**Documentation Testing Approach:**
1. **Technical Accuracy Testing:**
   - Execute all commands in documentation on clean Ubuntu 24.04 server
   - Verify expected output matches documented output
   - Test all configuration examples work as documented
   - Verify all file paths and service names are correct

2. **Completeness Testing:**
   - Create acceptance criteria coverage matrix (AC × Documentation File)
   - Verify each AC is covered by at least one documentation file
   - Check for gaps in user journey (installation → configuration → operation)
   - Verify all 14 services have documentation

3. **Clarity and Readability Testing:**
   - Native Portuguese speaker review (if available)
   - Test documentation with users unfamiliar with BorgStack
   - Verify technical terms are explained or linked
   - Check examples are clear and reproducible

4. **Navigation Testing:**
   - Verify all internal links work correctly
   - Verify all cross-references are accurate
   - Test "Previous/Next" navigation flow
   - Verify table of contents matches document structure

**Validation Checklist:**
```bash
# Test all commands in documentation
./tests/validate-docs.sh

# Check Markdown formatting
markdownlint docs/*.md docs/**/*.md

# Verify all links
markdown-link-check docs/*.md docs/**/*.md

# Count documentation coverage
./tests/count-documentation-coverage.sh
```

**Expected Documentation Metrics:**
- Total Portuguese documentation files: 20+ (8 main guides + 12 service guides + integration guides)
- Total lines of documentation: 5,000+ lines
- Acceptance criteria coverage: 100% (all 7 ACs covered)
- Service documentation coverage: 100% (all 14 services documented)
