## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**Key learnings from Story 4.1 (Directus Headless CMS):**

1. **Storage Strategy:** Story 4.1 used local volume storage initially (borgstack_directus_uploads) with migration plan to SeaweedFS in Story 5.1
2. **Prerequisite Verification:** Verified PostgreSQL, Redis, Caddy, and bootstrap.sh before implementation (Task 0)
3. **S3 Migration Template:** Created s3-storage.env.example for future SeaweedFS migration
4. **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive 26-test suite including API validation tests
5. **Documentation:** Both technical (README.md) and user guides (Portuguese) created

**Critical Pattern for Story 4.2:**
⚠️ **STORAGE DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION:** AC2 requires "Connection to SeaweedFS for storage working" but Story 5.1 (SeaweedFS deployment) hasn't been completed yet. Following Story 4.1's approach:
- Use local volumes (borgstack_fileflows_input, borgstack_fileflows_output, borgstack_fileflows_temp) for initial implementation
- Create S3/SeaweedFS migration template (config/fileflows/s3-storage.env.example) for Story 5.1
- Document clear migration path in README.md

### Architecture Context

**Service Purpose:**
FileFlows is an automated media file conversion and processing platform that watches input directories, applies transformation workflows, and outputs processed media.
[Source: architecture/components.md#fileflows-media-processing]

**Deployment Model:** Single container with FFmpeg-based processing engine
[Source: architecture/components.md#fileflows-media-processing]

### Component Details

**Container Specifications:**
[Source: architecture/components.md#fileflows-media-processing]
- Image: `revenz/fileflows:25.09`
- Exposed Port: 5000 (Web UI)
- Networks: `borgstack_internal`, `borgstack_external`
- Dependencies: SeaweedFS (file storage) - **Story 5.1 NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**

**Key Interfaces:**
- Web UI (port 5000) exposed via Caddy reverse proxy
- File processing engine watching input directories
- Output to SeaweedFS (Story 5.1) or local storage (Story 4.2 initial implementation)

**Technology Stack:**
- Processing Engine: FFmpeg for video/audio/image transcoding
- Workflow Builder: Visual flow designer for processing pipelines
- Node.js runtime for application logic

### Local Storage Configuration (Temporary until Story 5.1)

**Current Implementation (Story 4.2):**

FileFlows will use local Docker volumes for initial deployment:

```yaml
volumes:
  borgstack_fileflows_data:    # Application data and configuration
  borgstack_fileflows_logs:    # Processing logs
  borgstack_fileflows_temp:    # Temporary processing workspace
  borgstack_fileflows_input:   # Input media files (watch directory)
  borgstack_fileflows_output:  # Processed output files
```

**Volume Mounts:**
- `/config` → borgstack_fileflows_data (persistent configuration)
- `/logs` → borgstack_fileflows_logs (processing history)
- `/temp` → borgstack_fileflows_temp (scratch space for transcoding)
- `/input` → borgstack_fileflows_input (media input directory)
- `/output` → borgstack_fileflows_output (processed media output)

### Future SeaweedFS S3 Storage Configuration (Story 5.1)

**Planned Migration Path:**
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#seaweedfs-storage-organization]

After Story 5.1 (SeaweedFS deployment) is complete, FileFlows will migrate to S3-compatible storage:

```
SeaweedFS Bucket Structure:
/borgstack/fileflows/
  ├── input/       # Input media files
  ├── output/      # Processed media files
  └── temp/        # Temporary processing files
```

**Planned S3 Environment Variables (Story 5.1):**
- Storage Type: `s3`
- S3 Endpoint: `http://seaweedfs:8333`
- S3 Bucket: `borgstack`
- Input Prefix: `fileflows/input/`
- Output Prefix: `fileflows/output/`
- S3 Credentials: `${SEAWEEDFS_ACCESS_KEY}`, `${SEAWEEDFS_SECRET_KEY}`

**Migration Template:**
A configuration template will be created in `config/fileflows/s3-storage.env.example` for easy transition when Story 5.1 is complete.

### Media Processing Workflow Integration

**Workflow 4: Media File Processing Pipeline**
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-4-media-file-processing-pipeline]

FileFlows integrates with Directus and n8n for automated media processing:

1. **User uploads video** to Directus CMS
2. **Directus stores** file to SeaweedFS (Story 5.1) or local storage (Story 4.2)
3. **Directus triggers** n8n webhook with file metadata
4. **n8n calls** FileFlows API to start processing flow
5. **FileFlows downloads** source file from storage
6. **FileFlows processes** file (transcode H.264, normalize audio, optimize image)
7. **FileFlows uploads** processed file back to storage
8. **FileFlows webhooks** n8n with completion status
9. **n8n updates** Directus with processed file URL

**Processing Capabilities:**
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-4-media-file-processing-pipeline]
- **Video transcoding:** H.264/H.265 encoding, resolution scaling, bitrate optimization
- **Audio processing:** Normalization (loudnorm), format conversion, silence removal
- **Image optimization:** WebP conversion, resizing, compression
- **Batch processing:** Queue multiple files with priority scheduling

### Environment Variables Required

**Core Configuration:**
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#required-environment-variables]

- `FILEFLOWS_HOST=fileflows.${BORGSTACK_DOMAIN}` - Service hostname for Caddy routing
- `TZ=America/Sao_Paulo` - Timezone for log timestamps
- `PUID=1000` - User ID for file permissions
- `PGID=1000` - Group ID for file permissions

**Processing Configuration:**
- `FILEFLOWS_LOG_LEVEL=Information` - Logging verbosity (Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical)
- `FILEFLOWS_LICENSE_KEY` - Optional commercial license key for advanced features

**Storage Configuration (Story 4.2 - Local Volumes):**
- Input directory: `/input` (borgstack_fileflows_input volume)
- Output directory: `/output` (borgstack_fileflows_output volume)
- Temp directory: `/temp` (borgstack_fileflows_temp volume)

### Coding Standards

**Docker Compose Configuration:**
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-infrastructure-rules]

1. **Version Pinning:** Use exact version `revenz/fileflows:25.09` (NOT `latest`)
2. **Volume Naming:** `borgstack_fileflows_*` follows naming convention
3. **Network Isolation:** Connect to `borgstack_internal` (for future SeaweedFS access) and `borgstack_external` (Caddy)
4. **Health Checks:** Required - use HTTP check on port 5000 `/`
5. **Dependency Management:** Use `depends_on` with `service_started` for Caddy
6. **Configuration as Code:** Store FileFlows config in environment variables and mounted config files

**Security Requirements:**
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-infrastructure-rules]

- Never expose port 5000 to host in production (proxy via Caddy only)
- Set appropriate file permissions with PUID/PGID
- Restrict access to FileFlows UI via Caddy authentication if needed

### Caddy Reverse Proxy Configuration

**Expected Caddyfile Entry:**
[Source: architecture/components.md#caddy]

```
{$FILEFLOWS_HOST} {
    reverse_proxy fileflows:5000

    # Increase timeout for long-running media processing requests
    @long_running {
        path /api/flow/*
    }
    reverse_proxy @long_running fileflows:5000 {
        timeout 3600s
    }

    # WebSocket support for real-time processing status
    @websockets {
        header Connection *Upgrade*
        header Upgrade websocket
    }
    reverse_proxy @websockets fileflows:5000
}
```

**Security Headers:** Automatic via Caddy defaults
**SSL/TLS:** Automatic via Let's Encrypt

### Project Structure

**Configuration Files:**
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

```
borgstack/
├── config/fileflows/
│   ├── README.md                    # FileFlows setup documentation
│   ├── s3-storage.env.example       # S3 storage migration template for Story 5.1
│   └── example-flows.json           # Pre-configured processing flow templates
├── docs/03-services/

└── tests/deployment/
    └── verify-fileflows.sh          # Deployment validation script
```

### Testing

**Testing Philosophy:**
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]

- No unit tests (FileFlows is pre-built)
- Focus on deployment validation
- Configuration verification
- Processing workflow testing

**Validation Commands:**
```bash
# Validate docker-compose configuration
docker compose config | grep -A 30 "fileflows:"

# Test web UI endpoint
curl -f https://${FILEFLOWS_HOST}/

# Test file processing
docker compose cp test.mp4 fileflows:/input/
# Monitor processing in FileFlows UI

# Verify storage volumes
docker volume inspect borgstack_fileflows_input
docker volume inspect borgstack_fileflows_output

# Check processing logs
docker compose logs fileflows | grep -i "processing"
```

**Test Script Location:** `tests/deployment/verify-fileflows.sh`

### Integration Points

**FileFlows Integration with Other Services:**
[Source: architecture/components.md#component-diagrams]

1. **SeaweedFS:** Reads/writes media files via S3 API (Story 5.1) or local volumes (Story 4.2)
2. **Caddy:** Reverse proxy for HTTPS access to FileFlows web UI
3. **Directus:** Can trigger FileFlows via n8n webhook when media uploaded to CMS
4. **n8n:** Orchestrates media processing workflows (Directus → FileFlows → Directus update)
5. **Duplicati:** Backs up FileFlows configuration and processed media library

**n8n Integration Example:**
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-4-media-file-processing-pipeline]

```javascript
// n8n HTTP Request Node to trigger FileFlows processing
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "http://fileflows:5000/api/flow/trigger",
  "body": {
    "filename": "{{ $json.filename }}",
    "source_path": "/input/{{ $json.filename }}",
    "flow_id": "video-h264-transcode"
  }
}
```

### Troubleshooting Notes

**Common Issues:**

1. **Processing Failures:**
   - Check FFmpeg codec support: `docker compose exec fileflows ffmpeg -codecs`
   - Verify input file is not corrupted: `ffprobe <file>`
   - Check temp directory has sufficient disk space
   - Review FileFlows logs: `docker compose logs fileflows --tail=200`

2. **Storage Permission Issues:**
   - Verify PUID/PGID match host user: `id -u && id -g`
   - Check volume permissions: `docker compose exec fileflows ls -la /input /output /temp`
   - Ensure volumes are writable from container

3. **Performance Issues:**
   - Reduce concurrent processing limit if CPU saturated
   - Consider hardware transcoding (GPU passthrough) for better performance
   - Monitor server resources during processing: `docker stats fileflows`

4. **Web UI Not Accessible:**
   - Verify Caddy routing: `docker compose logs caddy | grep fileflows`
   - Check FileFlows container is healthy: `docker compose ps fileflows`
   - Test direct container access: `curl http://localhost:5000` (from host with port mapped)

### Migration to SeaweedFS (Story 5.1)

**Migration Steps (To be executed during Story 5.1):**

1. Stop FileFlows container: `docker compose stop fileflows`
2. Copy existing media from local volumes to SeaweedFS:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec seaweedfs s3cmd put --recursive \
     /mnt/borgstack_fileflows_input/ \
     s3://borgstack/fileflows/input/
   ```
3. Update docker-compose.yml: Remove local volume mounts, add S3 environment variables
4. Apply S3 configuration from `config/fileflows/s3-storage.env.example`
5. Restart FileFlows: `docker compose up -d fileflows`
6. Verify S3 connectivity and processing works
7. Archive local volumes after verification: `docker volume rm borgstack_fileflows_input borgstack_fileflows_output`

### Security Review

**Security Posture: EXCELLENT ✓**

All security best practices followed:

✓ **Network Isolation:**
- No port exposure to host (web UI accessed via Caddy reverse proxy only)
- Services on borgstack_internal (for future SeaweedFS access)
- External access on borgstack_external (Caddy routing)

✓ **Access Control:**
- HTTPS enforced via Caddy with automatic Let's Encrypt SSL
- Security headers configured (X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN, X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin)
- WebSocket support for real-time updates (secure connection)

✓ **File Permissions:**
- PUID/PGID configured for host user alignment (default 1000:1000)
- Volume permissions managed properly
- Temp directory isolated for processing workspace

✓ **Configuration Security:**
- All sensitive configuration in environment variables (not hardcoded)
- .env.example provides template without secrets
- Configuration files mounted read-only where appropriate

**No security concerns identified.**

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Design: WELL-OPTIMIZED ✓**

✓ **Resource Management:**
- Health check with appropriate timing (60s start_period for Node.js + FFmpeg initialization)
- Temp directory for FFmpeg scratch space (prevents disk I/O bottlenecks)
- Concurrent processing configurable via UI (default 2 jobs for 8 vCPU server)
- Processing node capacity guidelines documented

✓ **Long-Running Operations:**
- Caddy timeout configured for long-running media processing (3600s for /api/flow/*)
- Standard requests use normal timeout (default)
- WebSocket support for real-time status updates (reduces polling overhead)

✓ **Documentation:**
- Performance tuning guidelines in README.md
- Hardware transcoding options documented (GPU passthrough)
- Resource monitoring commands provided

**Performance Recommendations:**
- Monitor FileFlows resource usage during production workloads (docker stats fileflows)
- Adjust concurrent processing settings based on server CPU saturation
- Consider hardware transcoding for large media files (optional GPU passthrough)

**No performance concerns identified for MVP deployment.**
