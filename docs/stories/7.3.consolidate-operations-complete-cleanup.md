## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 7.1 (Consolidate Installation Documentation):**
[Source: docs/stories/7.1.consolidate-installation-documentation.md]

- **Documentation Quality Standards:** Story 7.1 achieved 90.3% reduction (3531 → 342 lines) with excellent Brazilian Portuguese quality. Story 7.3 must maintain same natural language standards.
- **Link Validation Critical:** Story 7.1 had 2 broken links caught by QA. Story 7.3 must verify all internal links functional before completion.
- **Placeholder Search:** Story 7.1 missed Portuguese placeholders ("SEU-USERNAME"). Story 7.3 must perform comprehensive case-insensitive search for placeholders before completion.
- **Diátaxis Framework Compliance:**
  - TROUBLESHOOTING.md should be How-to Guide documentation (task-oriented problem solving)
  - docs/integrations.md should be Explanation documentation (understanding integration patterns)
  - docs/maintenance.md should be How-to Guide documentation (checklists and procedures)
- **Command Verification:** All troubleshooting commands and maintenance procedures must be tested.

**From Story 7.2 (Remove Third-Party Documentation and Consolidate Configuration):**
[Source: docs/stories/7.2.remove-third-party-documentation-consolidate-configuration.md]

- **Documentation Reduction:** Story 7.2 achieved 94.9% reduction (12,476 → 635 lines). Story 7.3 must achieve similar aggressive consolidation.
- **Link Validation Critical:** Story 7.2 had 1 broken link (FileFlows docs URL) caught by QA. Story 7.3 must verify all official documentation URLs accessible before including.
- **Line Count Flexibility:** Story 7.2 exceeded targets slightly (CONFIGURATION.md: 230 vs 100-150, docs/services.md: 405 vs 200-300) for content completeness. This was justified and accepted by QA. Story 7.3 may do the same if needed for quality.
- **Protected Files Verification:** Must verify all protected files untouched after completion (same list as Stories 7.1 and 7.2).

### Epic 7 Context

**Epic 7 Goal:** Simplify BorgStack documentation from ~32,000 lines across 29 files to ~1,400 lines in 6 essential files.
[Source: docs/prd/epic-details.md Epic 7]

**Story 7.3 Scope:**
- Consolidate 13 files (6 individual files + 1 directory with 7 files) → 3 files (TROUBLESHOOTING.md + docs/integrations.md + docs/maintenance.md)
- Reduce from ~13,459 total lines → 400-500 lines (~97% reduction for this story)
- Focus on operations only (installation covered in 7.1, configuration covered in 7.2)
- This is the FINAL story in Epic 7 - must verify total Epic 7 goals achieved

**Story 7.3 is the final story in Epic 7:** After completion, all user-facing documentation will be consolidated into 6 essential files:
1. README.md (Story 7.1)
2. INSTALL.md (Story 7.1)
3. CONFIGURATION.md (Story 7.2)
4. TROUBLESHOOTING.md (Story 7.3)
5. docs/services.md (Story 7.2)
6. docs/integrations.md (Story 7.3)
7. docs/maintenance.md (Story 7.3)

Wait, that's 7 files, not 6. Let me recount based on Epic 7 description...

Actually, looking at the AC again, the final state should have these user-facing files:
- Root: README.md, INSTALL.md, CONFIGURATION.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- docs/: services.md, integrations.md, maintenance.md
- Total: 7 user-facing files

The "6 essential files" mentioned in Epic 7 may have been an approximation. The actual deliverable is 7 files with < 1,500 total lines.

**Protected Files - NEVER MODIFY OR DELETE:**
[Source: docs/prd/epic-details.md Epic 7 CRITICAL section]
- docs/brief.md
- docs/prd.md
- docs/architecture.md
- All files in: docs/prd/, docs/architecture/, docs/qa/, docs/stories/
- CLAUDE.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- LICENSE

### Architecture Context

**Documentation Standards:**
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **File Naming:** kebab-case.md for documentation files
- **Documentation Language:** Brazilian Portuguese for user-facing docs
- **Markdown Standards:**
  - Use GitHub-flavored markdown
  - Headers use ATX style (`#` not `===`)
  - Code blocks always have language specified
  - Links use reference style for readability

**Project Structure for Operational Documentation:**

**BorgStack Integration Patterns (for docs/integrations.md):**
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md, docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **n8n as Central Hub:** n8n connects all services via HTTP/webhook patterns (no direct service-to-service calls except databases)
- **Database Sharing:** PostgreSQL shared across n8n, Chatwoot, Directus, Evolution API with separate databases per service (n8n_db, chatwoot_db, directus_db, evolution_db)
- **Cache Sharing:** Redis shared across n8n, Chatwoot, Lowcoder, Directus for session management
- **Storage Integration:** SeaweedFS provides S3-compatible storage for Directus (CMS assets) and FileFlows (media processing)
- **Network Isolation:** borgstack_internal for service-to-service communication, borgstack_external for reverse proxy connectivity

**Common BorgStack Problems (for TROUBLESHOOTING.md):**

Based on architecture and coding standards, the 10 most common problems are likely:

1. **Healthcheck Failures:** Services fail to start due to depends_on health check timeouts
   - [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#health-check-requirements]
2. **SSL Certificate Failures:** Caddy Let's Encrypt fails (DNS, firewall, rate limits)
   - [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#ssl-tls]
3. **Database Connection Refused:** PostgreSQL not ready before dependent services start
   - [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#dependency-management]
4. **Out of Memory Errors:** OOM killer terminates containers (insufficient RAM)
   - [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#performance-baselines - 36GB RAM minimum]
5. **Slow Performance / High CPU:** Resource bottlenecks, inefficient queries
   - [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#performance-troubleshooting-guide]
6. **Volume Permission Errors:** Docker volume ownership issues (UID/GID mismatches)
   - [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#configuration-as-code]
7. **Port Conflicts:** "address already in use" errors (80, 443, or service ports)
   - [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#network-isolation]
8. **Backup Failures:** Duplicati backup errors (destination unreachable, encryption key lost)
   - [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#backup-destination]
9. **Service-Specific Crashes:** n8n, Chatwoot, Evolution API crashes (misconfigurations, missing env vars)
   - [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#application-services]
10. **Update/Migration Failures:** Breaking changes after version updates
    - [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#backup-before-updates]

**Maintenance Checklists (for docs/maintenance.md):**
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md, docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- **Backup Checklist:**
  - Daily automated backups via Duplicati
  - Weekly backup verification (test restore)
  - Monthly full restore test

- **Update Checklist:**
  - Pre-update: backup (./scripts/backup-now.sh), review changelog, test in staging
  - Update: docker compose pull, down, update docker-compose.yml, up -d, verify health
  - Post-update: check logs, monitor performance 24h
  - Rollback: restore docker-compose.yml, pull old images, restore database if needed
- **Security Checklist:**
  - Initial: change default passwords, strong encryption keys, firewall (ufw), auto-updates

## Testing

### Test Requirements

**Documentation Testing Approach:**
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**No Unit Tests Required:**
- Documentation is not code
- Focus on manual validation and content accuracy testing
- Verify all troubleshooting commands functional
- Test all maintenance procedures

**Testing Checklist for Story 7.3:**

1. **Content Accuracy Testing:**
   - Verify all 10 troubleshooting problems have working solutions
   - Test all troubleshooting commands (docker compose logs, docker stats, etc.)
   - Verify all integration patterns documented match actual architecture
   - Test all maintenance procedures (backup, update, security checklists)

2. **Link Validation:**
   - Test all internal markdown links (README.md → TROUBLESHOOTING.md, etc.)
   - Verify all cross-references to other documentation files work
   - Ensure no broken links after deletions

3. **Line Count Validation:**
   - `wc -l TROUBLESHOOTING.md` → 100-150 lines
   - `wc -l docs/integrations.md` → 150-200 lines
   - `wc -l docs/maintenance.md` → 100-150 lines
   - Total user-facing docs < 1,500 lines

4. **Deletion Safety:**
   - Verify only intended files deleted (13 files total: 6 individual + 7 in directory)
   - Confirm all protected files unchanged
   - Run git status to verify deletions

5. **Epic 7 Completion Validation:**
   - Total documentation reduction: ~32,000 lines → ~1,400 lines (~95% reduction)
   - 6-7 essential files created across Stories 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
   - 29 old documentation files deleted across 3 stories
   - All internal links functional across new documentation structure

6. **Portuguese Quality Check:**
   - Grammar and spelling verification
   - Terminology consistency with Stories 7.1, 7.2, 6.2-6.4
   - Natural language flow (conversational, not overly formal)

**Validation Commands:**

```bash
# 1. Verify line counts for Story 7.3 files
wc -l TROUBLESHOOTING.md docs/integrations.md docs/maintenance.md
# Expected: TROUBLESHOOTING.md 100-150, docs/integrations.md 150-200, docs/maintenance.md 100-150

# 2. Verify total user-facing documentation < 1,500 lines
wc -l README.md INSTALL.md CONFIGURATION.md TROUBLESHOOTING.md docs/services.md docs/integrations.md docs/maintenance.md | tail -1
# Expected: total < 1,500 lines

# 3. Verify old files deleted
ls docs/05-solucao-de-problemas.md docs/06-manutencao.md docs/07-seguranca.md docs/08-desempenho.md docs/09-workflows-exemplo.md docs/POST_MVP_MULTI_TENANT_ARCHITECTURE.md 2>/dev/null
ls -d docs/04-integrations/ 2>/dev/null
# Expected: "No such file or directory" for all

# 4. Verify protected files exist
ls docs/brief.md docs/prd.md docs/architecture.md CLAUDE.md CONTRIBUTING.md LICENSE
ls -d docs/prd/ docs/architecture/ docs/qa/ docs/stories/
# Expected: All files/directories exist

# 5. Verify final docs/ directory structure
ls docs/
# Expected: services.md, integrations.md, maintenance.md, brief.md, prd.md, architecture.md, prd/, architecture/, qa/, stories/

# 6. Test troubleshooting commands
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=100
docker stats --no-stream
# Expected: All commands functional

# 7. Test maintenance commands
docker compose pull
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
# Expected: All commands functional (test in staging environment)

# 8. Check for Portuguese placeholders
grep -ri "SEU-\|YOUR-\|CHANGE_ME\|FIXME\|TODO" TROUBLESHOOTING.md docs/integrations.md docs/maintenance.md
# Expected: Only acceptable placeholders in optional/commented sections
```
