# Story 1.2: Docker Network Configuration (Epic 1 - Foundation & Core Infrastructure)

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** internal Docker networks configured for secure inter-service communication,
**so that** components can communicate safely while maintaining proper isolation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Internal network `borgstack_internal` validated in docker-compose.yml
2. External network `borgstack_external` validated for reverse proxy connectivity
3. Network security policies documented between networks
4. Service discovery via DNS names documented (validation deferred to Story 6.1 when services exist)
5. Network isolation configuration documented and verified in docker-compose.yml (service-level testing deferred to Stories 1.3-1.7)
6. Port mapping strategy documented for external access

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.1 Completion]

Story 1.1 established the foundational repository structure including:
- Docker Compose v2 format already established in docker-compose.yml
- Networks `borgstack_internal` and `borgstack_external` fully implemented in docker-compose.yml
- Network `borgstack_internal` configured with `internal: true` for security isolation
- Network `borgstack_external` configured with bridge driver for reverse proxy access
- All configuration files follow Configuration as Code approach (version controlled)

**Key Takeaway:** Networks were fully implemented in Story 1.1. This story validates the implementation, documents network security policies, creates comprehensive testing procedures, and prepares service-to-network assignment guidelines for future service stories (1.3-1.7).

### Network Architecture Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#security]

**Network Isolation Strategy:**
- **borgstack_internal:** Bridge network for service-to-service communication (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, all application services)
- **borgstack_external:** Bridge network for reverse proxy access (Caddy only)
- Services needing external access connect to BOTH networks (e.g., application services need internal DB access AND external proxy access)
- Databases and caches connect ONLY to borgstack_internal for security

**Service Discovery:**
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#infrastructure-deployment]
- Docker DNS automatically resolves service names to container IPs within the same network
- Connection strings use service names directly: `postgresql:5432`, `redis:6379`, `mongodb:27017`
- No manual IP configuration needed; Docker handles DNS resolution

### Docker Compose Network Configuration Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Network Security Rules:**

1. **Network Naming Convention:**
   ```yaml
   networks:
     borgstack_internal:
       driver: bridge
     borgstack_external:
       driver: bridge
   ```
   - Prefix all networks with `borgstack_` for namespace isolation
   - Use descriptive purpose names: `_internal` for service communication, `_external` for proxy access

2. **Port Exposure Policy:**
   ```yaml
   # ✅ Correct - Database with no host port exposure
   postgresql:
     networks:
       - borgstack_internal
     # NO ports: section in production

   # ❌ Wrong - Database exposed to host (security risk)
   postgresql:
     ports:
       - "5432:5432"
   ```
   [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#network-isolation]
   - Databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis) must NEVER expose ports to host in production
   - Port mappings only allowed in docker-compose.override.yml for local development
   - All external access flows through Caddy reverse proxy on ports 80/443

3. **Multi-Network Service Configuration:**
   ```yaml
   # Services needing both internal DB access and external web access
   n8n:
     networks:
       - borgstack_internal  # For PostgreSQL, Redis connections
       - borgstack_external  # For Caddy reverse proxy

   # Services needing only internal access
   postgresql:
     networks:
       - borgstack_internal  # No external access

   # Services needing only external access
   caddy:
     networks:
       - borgstack_external  # Routes traffic to services
     ports:
       - "80:80"
       - "443:443"
   ```

### File Locations and Modifications
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Primary File to Modify:**
- `docker-compose.yml` - Define the two networks in the top-level `networks:` section

**Optional Files to Create:**
- `tests/deployment/verify-network-isolation.sh` - Test script to verify network configuration
- Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` if additional network validation is needed

**Files Already Created in Story 1.1:**
- `docker-compose.override.yml` - Local development overrides (can add dev port mappings here)
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production configuration (ensure minimal port exposure)

### Network Security Considerations
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#security]

**Security Best Practices:**
1. **Defense in Depth:** Network isolation is the first layer of defense; even if a service is compromised, attacker cannot directly access databases
2. **Minimal Surface Area:** Only Caddy should accept connections from external networks (ports 80/443)
3. **Internal-Only Services:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis should be unreachable from host or external networks
4. **Development vs Production:** docker-compose.override.yml can expose ports for debugging, but docker-compose.prod.yml must not

### Testing Approach
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Philosophy:**
- No unit tests required (infrastructure project, not application development)
- Focus on deployment validation and configuration verification
- Ensure network isolation works as designed

**Network Validation Tests:**

1. **Configuration Validation:**
   ```bash
   # Verify docker-compose.yml syntax includes network definitions
   docker compose config --quiet  # Must exit 0

   # Check networks are defined
   docker compose config | grep -A5 "networks:"
   ```

2. **Network Existence Verification:**
   ```bash
   # After deployment, verify networks exist
   docker network ls | grep borgstack_internal
   docker network ls | grep borgstack_external
   ```

3. **Network Configuration Test:**
   ```bash
   # Verify borgstack_internal has internal flag set
   docker network inspect borgstack_internal --format '{{.Internal}}'
   # Expected output: true

   # Verify borgstack_external does not have internal flag
   docker network inspect borgstack_external --format '{{.Internal}}'
   # Expected output: false
   ```

   Note: Service discovery tests (DNS resolution) will be performed in Story 6.1 Integration Testing when services are deployed.

4. **Network Configuration Validation:**
   ```bash
   # Verify network configuration in docker-compose.yml
   docker compose config | grep -A 5 "networks:"
   # Verify borgstack_internal and borgstack_external are defined

   # Verify internal network has correct settings
   docker compose config | grep -A 3 "borgstack_internal:" | grep "internal: true"
   ```

   Note: Network isolation tests (verifying databases are not accessible from host) will be performed in Stories 1.3-1.7 when database services are deployed.

5. **Port Exposure Verification:**
   ```bash
   # Verify no services currently expose ports (services don't exist yet)
   docker compose config | grep -A 20 "services:" | grep "ports:" || echo "PASS: No port exposure in base configuration"

   # This test will be enhanced in Story 1.5 (Caddy) to verify only Caddy exposes ports 80/443
   ```

**Test Script Location:**
- Create `tests/deployment/verify-network-isolation.sh` with the above tests
- Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run network validation after config validation

### Project Structure Alignment

**No Structural Conflicts:**
- docker-compose.yml already exists from Story 1.1
- This story adds/modifies the `networks:` section in that file
- Test scripts follow existing structure: `tests/deployment/` directory already exists
- CI workflow already validates Docker Compose configuration

**Alignment Notes:**
- Network naming follows established `borgstack_*` convention from Story 1.1
- Configuration as Code approach maintained (networks defined in version-controlled docker-compose.yml)
- No new directories needed; work within existing structure

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Focus:**
- Deployment validation: Verify networks are created correctly
- Configuration verification: Ensure docker-compose.yml network definitions are valid
- Security validation: Confirm network isolation prevents unauthorized access

**Test Requirements:**
1. Docker Compose configuration syntax validation (already in CI from Story 1.1)
2. Network existence verification (networks defined in docker-compose.yml)
3. Network configuration validation (internal flag, driver settings)
4. Network security documentation completeness
5. Port exposure policy verification (no unauthorized ports in base config)

Note: Service discovery tests and network isolation tests will be performed in later stories when services are deployed (Stories 1.3-1.7 for databases, Story 6.1 for integration testing).

**Test Execution Commands:**
```bash
# Configuration validation (CI)
docker compose config --quiet

# Network verification
docker compose config | grep -A 5 "networks:"
docker network ls | grep borgstack  # After docker compose up

# Network configuration validation
docker network inspect borgstack_internal --format '{{.Internal}}'  # Should be: true
docker network inspect borgstack_external --format '{{.Internal}}'  # Should be: false

# Port exposure verification
docker compose config | grep -A 20 "services:" | grep "ports:" || echo "PASS: No port exposure"
```

**Success Criteria:**
- docker-compose.yml passes validation with network definitions
- Both `borgstack_internal` and `borgstack_external` networks are properly configured
- `borgstack_internal` has `internal: true` setting for security isolation
- `borgstack_external` is configured for reverse proxy access
- Network security policies are comprehensively documented
- No unauthorized port exposure in base configuration
- Service-to-network assignment strategy documented for future stories

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Grade: EXCELLENT (95/100)**

The implementation demonstrates exceptional quality with comprehensive inline documentation, robust test coverage, and proper adherence to security best practices. The docker-compose.yml network configuration includes extensive comments documenting service-to-network assignment strategies for all future stories (1.3-4.2), Docker DNS service discovery examples, and security policies. The test script is well-structured with clear separation of concerns, color-coded output, and proper error handling.

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive inline documentation serving as architectural guide for future service implementation
- Proper network isolation with `internal: true` flag preventing external host access
- Well-designed test script with 8 validation tests covering all acceptance criteria
- Clear separation of "validate now" vs "defer to Story 6.1" testing approach
- CI integration ensures validation on every push

### Refactoring Performed

**Critical Bug Fix Applied:**

- **File**: tests/deployment/verify-network-isolation.sh:124-135
  - **Change**: Fixed network naming validation logic (TEST 6)
  - **Why**: Original grep pipeline had flawed logic that would NOT detect invalid network names. The command `grep -E "^  [a-z_]+:" docker-compose.yml | grep -A 100 "^networks:"` would always produce empty output because two-space indented network names don't match `^networks:` pattern. This created a false positive - test would pass even with invalid networks.
  - **How**: Replaced with robust sed-based extraction: `sed -n '/^networks:/,/^[^ ]/{/^  [a-z_-]\+:/p}'` that correctly extracts network names from the networks section and validates naming convention. Verified fix catches invalid networks with test cases.

- **File**: .github/workflows/ci.yml:70-81
  - **Change**: Applied same bug fix to CI workflow network validation
  - **Why**: Workflow had identical flawed logic that would not catch naming violations
  - **How**: Replaced with same corrected sed-based pattern ensuring CI properly enforces naming conventions

### Requirements Traceability

**AC1: Internal network validated**
- Given docker-compose.yml has a networks section
- When borgstack_internal network is defined
- Then it should have driver: bridge and internal: true
- **Tests**: verify-network-isolation.sh:63-69 (existence), :82-88 (internal flag), :94-99 (driver)

**AC2: External network validated**
- Given docker-compose.yml has a networks section
- When borgstack_external network is defined
- Then it should have driver: bridge without internal flag
- **Tests**: verify-network-isolation.sh:71-77 (existence), :101-105 (driver)

**AC3: Network security policies documented**
- Given services need secure communication
- When network configuration is defined
- Then security policies should be documented for service-to-network assignments
- **Documentation**: docker-compose.yml:34-64 (internal network), :65-88 (external network)

**AC4: Service discovery documented**
- Given services will communicate via Docker DNS
- When network configuration is complete
- Then DNS-based service discovery should be documented with examples
- **Documentation**: docker-compose.yml:53-58 (DNS examples with connection strings)
- **Note**: Actual DNS resolution testing properly deferred to Story 6.1

**AC5: Network isolation verified**
- Given borgstack_internal network exists
- When internal: true is set
- Then network should prevent external host access
- **Tests**: verify-network-isolation.sh:82-88
- **Documentation**: docker-compose.yml:38 (internal: true with security explanation)

**AC6: Port mapping strategy documented**
- Given external access is required
- When port exposure strategy is defined
- Then only Caddy should expose ports 80/443
- **Documentation**: docker-compose.yml:60-63, :84-88
- **Tests**: verify-network-isolation.sh:110-117

### Security Review

**Status: PASS** - Network security properly implemented

**Findings:**
- ✓ Internal network has `internal: true` flag preventing external host access (defense in depth)
- ✓ No database port exposure in base configuration
- ✓ Documentation clearly states databases must never expose ports in production
- ✓ Port mapping strategy documented: only Caddy will expose ports 80/443
- ✓ Multi-network pattern documented for services needing both internal DB access and external routing

**Security Best Practices Applied:**
- Network isolation as first layer of defense
- Minimal attack surface (only Caddy accepts external connections)
- Clear documentation preventing future security misconfigurations

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS** - Appropriate for infrastructure configuration

- Bridge driver is correct choice for Docker network performance
