## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.5 completion notes]
- Environment variables should have defaults for testing where possible
- Comprehensive inline documentation is critical for maintainability
- Security configurations (like CORS) should be documented with warnings
- All configurations must be validated before deployment
- CI integration ensures scripts remain functional across changes

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Operating System:**
- Ubuntu Server LTS 24.04 (Long-term support until 2029)
- Excellent Docker compatibility
- Bash 5.x (Ubuntu default) for scripting

**Required Software:**
- Docker Engine: Latest stable version (installed by bootstrap script)
- Docker Compose: v2 (latest) - Plugin architecture, not standalone binary
- Git: Latest stable (for repository cloning)
- UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall): For firewall management

**Minimum Server Requirements (Testing):**
- 4 vCPUs
- 16GB RAM
- 200GB SSD storage

**Recommended Server Requirements (Production):**
- 8 vCPUs
- 36GB RAM
- 500GB SSD storage

### Project Structure Alignment
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md, architecture/source-tree.md]

**Bootstrap Script Location:**
```
borgstack/
├── scripts/
│   ├── bootstrap.sh              # Ubuntu 24.04 automated setup (THIS STORY)
│   ├── healthcheck.sh            # Post-deployment verification (Future: Story 6.1)
│   ├── backup-now.sh             # Manual backup trigger (Future: Story 5.2)

│   └── generate-env.sh           # Interactive .env generator (Future: Story 6.2)
```

**Note:** This is the FIRST script to be created in the scripts/ directory. Directory currently exists with .gitkeep only.

### Deployment Checklist Requirements
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#deployment-checklist]

**Pre-Deployment Validations (Bootstrap Script Must Check):**
1. Server running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (exact version match required)
2. Server meets resource requirements (CPU, RAM, disk space)
3. DNS A records configured pointing to server IP (user responsibility, script reminds)
4. Firewall configuration (script automates with UFW)
5. Non-root user with sudo privileges (script assumes user has sudo)
6. Docker and Docker Compose v2 installed (script automates)

**Deployment Steps (Bootstrap Script Must Execute):**
1. Install Docker Engine and Docker Compose v2
2. Install required system dependencies
3. Configure UFW firewall rules
4. Generate .env file with strong passwords
5. Pull all Docker images
6. Start all services
7. Validate service health checks
8. Display next steps (DNS, SSL, admin access)

**Post-Deployment Instructions (Bootstrap Script Must Display):**
1. DNS A record configuration for 7 subdomains
2. SSL certificate automatic generation explanation
3. Admin account creation for each service
4. Password management recommendations
5. Service access URLs

### Environment Variable Requirements
[Source: .env.example from Stories 1.3, 1.4, 1.5]

**Environment Variables to Generate:**

**PostgreSQL Database (Story 1.3):**
- POSTGRES_PASSWORD (16+ chars, strong password)
- N8N_DB_PASSWORD (16+ chars, strong password)
- CHATWOOT_DB_PASSWORD (16+ chars, strong password)
- DIRECTUS_DB_PASSWORD (16+ chars, strong password)
- EVOLUTION_DB_PASSWORD (16+ chars, strong password)

**MongoDB Database (Story 1.7):**
- MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME (default: mongoadmin)
- MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD (16+ chars, strong password)

**Redis Cache (Story 1.4):**
- REDIS_PASSWORD (16+ chars, strong password)

**Caddy Reverse Proxy (Story 1.5):**
- DOMAIN (user input required, e.g., example.com.br)
- EMAIL (user input required, e.g., admin@example.com.br)
- CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS (default "*" for development, warn for production)

**Application Secrets (Future Stories):**
- N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY (32+ chars, hex or base64)
- CHATWOOT_SECRET_KEY_BASE (64+ chars)
- DIRECTUS_SECRET (32+ chars)
- EVOLUTION_JWT_SECRET (32+ chars)

**Password Generation Requirements:**
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#password-policy]
- Minimum 12 characters (recommend 16 for automation)
- Must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
- Use strong random generation (e.g., /dev/urandom, openssl rand)
- Each service must have unique password (no reuse)

**Password Generation Implementation:**
Use the following bash function for consistent password generation:
```bash
generate_password() {
  # Generate 32-character password using OpenSSL
  # Remove problematic characters (=, +, /) that may cause issues in .env files
  openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d "=+/" | cut -c1-32
}

# Usage example:
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(generate_password)
```
This method ensures:
- Strong entropy from OpenSSL's cryptographic random number generator
- 32 characters length (exceeds minimum requirement)
- Alphanumeric characters only (no special chars that break .env parsing)
- Consistent format across all generated passwords

### Security Requirements
[Source: architecture/security-and-performance.md#network-security, #data-security]

**Firewall Configuration (UFW):**
```bash
# Default policies
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# Allow SSH (port 22, adjust if using custom port)
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

# Allow HTTP/HTTPS for Caddy
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp

# Enable firewall
sudo ufw enable
```

**Secret Management:**
- Never commit .env files to git (already in .gitignore from Story 1.1)
- Set .env file permissions to 600 (readable only by owner)
- Use strong, unique passwords for each service (minimum 12 characters, recommend 16+)
- Display warning to user: Save passwords in secure password manager (e.g., 1Password, Bitwarden)
- Recommend credential rotation every 90 days

**Encryption at Rest:**
- .env file: 600 permissions enforced by script
- Backup encryption: Duplicati (Story 5.2 handles this)
- Full disk encryption (LUKS): Optional, recommended for production (bootstrap script should suggest)

### Docker Installation Requirements
[Source: Docker official documentation for Ubuntu - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/]
[Architecture Reference: architecture/tech-stack.md specifies "Docker Engine: Latest stable version"]

**Docker Engine Installation Steps (Ubuntu 24.04):**
```bash
# Remove old Docker versions if present
sudo apt remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc

# Install dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ca-certificates curl gnupg

# Add Docker's official GPG key
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Add Docker APT repository
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Install Docker Engine and Compose plugin
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

# Add user to docker group (non-root access)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Start and enable Docker service
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

# Verify installation
docker --version
docker compose version
```

**IMPORTANT:** Use `docker compose` (v2 plugin) NOT `docker-compose` (v1 standalone binary)

### DNS Configuration Requirements
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md#deployment-checklist, Story 1.5]

**Required DNS A Records (7 subdomains):**
```
n8n.<DOMAIN>        IN  A  <SERVER_IP>
chatwoot.<DOMAIN>   IN  A  <SERVER_IP>
evolution.<DOMAIN>  IN  A  <SERVER_IP>
lowcoder.<DOMAIN>   IN  A  <SERVER_IP>
directus.<DOMAIN>   IN  A  <SERVER_IP>
fileflows.<DOMAIN>  IN  A  <SERVER_IP>
duplicati.<DOMAIN>  IN  A  <SERVER_IP>
```

**DNS Verification Command:**
```bash
dig n8n.<DOMAIN> +short
# Should return <SERVER_IP>
```

**SSL Certificate Requirements:**
- Let's Encrypt automatic SSL via Caddy (Story 1.5 configured this)
- Port 80 must be open for ACME HTTP-01 challenge
- Port 443 must be open for HTTPS access
- Certificates generated automatically on first request to each subdomain
- 30-60 second delay per domain on first access
- Caddy handles automatic renewal (30 days before expiration)

### Health Check Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#health-check-requirements]

**Services with Health Checks (Defined in docker-compose.yml):**
1. Caddy: HTTP request to admin API (port 2019)
2. PostgreSQL: `pg_isready -U postgres`
3. MongoDB: `mongosh --eval "db.adminCommand('ping')"`
4. Redis: `redis-cli ping`

**Bootstrap Script Validation:**
- Wait 60 seconds after `docker compose up -d` for service initialization
- Check `docker compose ps` output for health status
- Services should show "healthy" status
- If any service shows "unhealthy", display troubleshooting message

### Error Handling and User Experience
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md, architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]

**Script Error Handling Best Practices:**
- Use `set -euo pipefail` at script start (exit on error, undefined vars, pipe failures)
- Provide clear error messages with actionable instructions
- Use color coding for output: Green (success), Yellow (warning), Red (error)
- Display progress indicators for long-running operations
- Log all actions to `/tmp/borgstack-bootstrap.log` for troubleshooting
- Provide summary at end: Success/failure status, next steps

**User Prompts:**
- Default values for non-sensitive inputs (e.g., DOMAIN placeholder)
- Clear explanations for each prompt
- Validation of user input (e.g., domain format validation)
- Confirmation before destructive actions (e.g., overwriting .env)

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Shell Script Naming:**
- File: `bootstrap.sh` (kebab-case.sh convention)
- Location: `scripts/bootstrap.sh`
- Executable: `chmod +x scripts/bootstrap.sh`

**Shell Script Best Practices:**
- Shebang: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- Error handling: `set -euo pipefail`
- Functions for reusable logic
- Clear inline comments explaining each section
- Color output for readability (tput colors)
- Progress indicators for user feedback

**Git Commit Standards:**
- Imperative mood, lowercase
- Example: `add bootstrap script for ubuntu 24.04 automated setup`

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Philosophy:**
- **No unit tests**: Bootstrap script is Bash; focus on integration validation
- **Deployment validation**: Ensure script successfully sets up environment
- **Idempotency testing**: Script should be safe to run multiple times
- **Failure scenario testing**: Verify graceful error handling

### Test Requirements

**Test 1: Ubuntu Version Validation**
```bash
# Verify script detects Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
# Expected: Success on Ubuntu 24.04, clear error on other versions
```

**Test 2: System Requirements Check**
```bash
# Verify script validates RAM, CPU, disk space
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
# Expected: Exit with error if requirements not met, display current vs required values
```

**Test 3: Docker Installation Verification**
```bash
# Run bootstrap script
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Verify Docker installed
docker --version
# Expected: Docker version 20.x or higher

# Verify Docker Compose v2 installed
docker compose version
# Expected: Docker Compose version v2.x.x

# Verify user in docker group
groups | grep docker
# Expected: docker group listed
```

**Test 4: Firewall Configuration Verification**
```bash
# Run bootstrap script
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Verify UFW enabled and configured
sudo ufw status
# Expected: Status: active
# Expected: 22/tcp ALLOW
# Expected: 80/tcp ALLOW
# Expected: 443/tcp ALLOW
```

**Test 5: .env File Generation and Security**
```bash
# Run bootstrap script with test inputs
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Verify .env file created
ls -la .env
# Expected: File exists with 600 permissions (-rw-------)

# Verify all required variables set
grep -q "POSTGRES_PASSWORD" .env
grep -q "DOMAIN" .env
grep -q "EMAIL" .env
# Expected: All variables found

# Verify passwords are strong (16+ chars)
grep "POSTGRES_PASSWORD" .env | wc -c
# Expected: > 20 characters (16 for password + variable name + =)
```

**Test 6: Docker Image Pull Verification**
```bash
# Run bootstrap script
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Verify all images pulled
docker images | grep caddy
docker images | grep pgvector
docker images | grep mongo
docker images | grep redis
# Expected: All core infrastructure images present
```

**Test 7: Service Health Check Validation**
```bash
# Run bootstrap script
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Verify services are healthy
docker compose ps
# Expected: All services show "Up" status
# Expected: Health check shows "healthy" for services with health checks

# Verify Caddy is running
docker compose ps caddy | grep "Up"
# Expected: Caddy running

# Verify PostgreSQL is healthy
docker compose exec postgresql pg_isready -U postgres
# Expected: "accepting connections"

# Verify Redis is healthy
docker compose exec redis redis-cli ping
# Expected: "PONG"
```

**Test 8: Idempotency Testing**
```bash
# Run bootstrap script first time
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Run bootstrap script second time
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
# Expected: Script detects existing installation
# Expected: Skips Docker installation if already installed
# Expected: Warns about existing .env file, skips generation
# Expected: No errors, graceful handling of existing setup
```

**Test 9: DNS Configuration Instructions**
```bash
# Run bootstrap script
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Verify DNS instructions displayed
# Expected: 7 subdomain examples shown with user's domain
# Expected: dig verification command shown
# Expected: SSL certificate explanation shown
```

**Test 10: DNS Configuration Verification**
```bash
# Run bootstrap script
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# Verify DNS records are configured for all 7 subdomains
DOMAIN=$(grep "^DOMAIN=" .env | cut -d= -f2)

for subdomain in n8n chatwoot evolution lowcoder directus fileflows duplicati; do
  echo "Checking DNS for ${subdomain}.${DOMAIN}..."
  IP=$(dig ${subdomain}.${DOMAIN} +short)

  if [ -z "$IP" ]; then
    echo "❌ WARNING: DNS not configured for ${subdomain}.${DOMAIN}"
  else
    echo "✅ DNS configured: ${subdomain}.${DOMAIN} → ${IP}"
  fi
done

# Expected: All 7 subdomains return server IP address
# If any subdomain returns empty: DNS not configured, SSL generation will fail
# Script should warn user but not block deployment (DNS can be configured after)
```

**Test 11: Error Handling and Rollback**
```bash
# Simulate failure scenario (e.g., insufficient disk space)
# Run bootstrap script
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
# Expected: Clear error message
# Expected: Actionable troubleshooting steps
# Expected: Log file location displayed: /tmp/borgstack-bootstrap.log
```

### Test Script Location

### Improvements Checklist

All items reviewed and assessed. Implementation is production-ready with three non-critical improvement opportunities for future sprints:

- [ ] **SEC-001 (Medium):** Add interactive CORS configuration prompt during bootstrap execution (Priority: Medium, Effort: 1-2 hours)
- [ ] **REL-001 (Low):** Implement health check retry logic (3-5 attempts, 10s intervals) (Priority: Low, Effort: 1 hour)
- [ ] **UX-001 (Low):** Add optional DNS verification step with skip option (Priority: Low, Effort: 2-3 hours)
- [ ] Consider extracting password generation to separate validation function (Priority: Low, Effort: 30 minutes)

**Note:** None of these items block production deployment. All are enhancement opportunities identified for continuous improvement.

### Security Review

**Status:** CONCERNS (Non-blocking)

**Strengths:**
- ✓ **Password Generation:** Uses `openssl rand -base64 32` for cryptographic random generation
- ✓ **Password Length:** 32 characters (exceeds 16-char minimum requirement)
- ✓ **File Permissions:** .env file set to 600 (owner read/write only)
- ✓ **Firewall Configuration:** UFW configured with deny incoming/allow outgoing policy before deployment
- ✓ **Network Isolation:** No database ports exposed to host (validated in other CI tests)
- ✓ **Idempotency:** Safe to run multiple times, no destructive operations
- ✓ **Backup Strategy:** Existing .env backed up before overwrite

**Concerns:**
- ⚠ **SEC-001 (Medium):** CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS defaults to "*" wildcard in bootstrap.sh:419
  - **Impact:** Potential security risk if user deploys to production without changing
  - **Mitigation:** Documented with prominent warnings in both bootstrap.sh and .env.example
  - **Status:** Acceptable for MVP - user explicitly prompted to change for production
  - **Recommendation:** Consider interactive CORS prompt during bootstrap for better security posture

**Overall Security Posture:** Strong security implementation with documented security boundaries. Single medium concern (CORS wildcard) is well-documented and acceptable for MVP deployment.

### Performance Considerations

**Status:** PASS

**Strengths:**
- ✓ Efficient operations with no unnecessary loops
- ✓ Silent apt operations (`-qq` flag) for faster execution
- ✓ Parallel Docker image pulls via `docker compose pull`
- ✓ Single-pass .env file generation
- ✓ Minimal system resource usage during execution

**No performance issues identified.**

### Reliability Assessment

**Status:** CONCERNS (Non-blocking)

**Strengths:**
- ✓ **Error Handling:** `set -euo pipefail` catches all errors, undefined variables, and pipe failures
- ✓ **Comprehensive Logging:** All operations logged to `/tmp/borgstack-bootstrap.log`
- ✓ **Graceful Failures:** Clear error messages with actionable troubleshooting steps
- ✓ **Idempotency:** Detects existing Docker installation, .env file, UFW rules
- ✓ **Backup Strategy:** Existing .env backed up with timestamp before overwrite
- ✓ **User Feedback:** Color-coded output, progress indicators, clear status messages

**Concerns:**
- ⚠ **REL-001 (Low):** Health checks run once after 60s wait, no retry logic
  - **Impact:** May fail on slower systems or busy servers during initial deployment
  - **Current Behavior:** Displays warnings but allows deployment to continue
  - **Status:** Acceptable for MVP - users can manually verify with `docker compose ps`
  - **Recommendation:** Add retry loop (3-5 attempts, 10s intervals) for more robust validation

**Overall Reliability:** Excellent error handling and logging. Minor concern about health check robustness is acceptable for MVP.

### Testability Evaluation

**Controllability:** Excellent
Interactive prompts allow various test scenarios, idempotency allows safe re-runs, functions can be tested individually.

**Observability:** Excellent
Color-coded output, comprehensive logging to `/tmp/borgstack-bootstrap.log`, clear success/failure messages, log file location displayed to user.

**Debuggability:** Excellent
Comprehensive log file with all operations, clear error messages with context, troubleshooting commands displayed, actionable failure messages.
