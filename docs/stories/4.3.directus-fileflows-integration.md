## Dev Notes

### Integration Architecture Overview

Story 4.3 implements automated media processing integration between Directus CMS and FileFlows using n8n as the orchestration layer. This follows the **Media File Processing Pipeline** pattern defined in the architecture.

[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-4-media-file-processing-pipeline]

### Integration Pattern

The integration uses a **webhook-based event-driven architecture**:

1. **Upload Trigger**: User uploads media file to Directus CMS
2. **Webhook to n8n**: Directus fires webhook to n8n on file upload
3. **Processing Trigger**: n8n calls FileFlows API to start processing
4. **File Processing**: FileFlows processes media file (transcode, optimize, convert)
5. **Completion Webhook**: FileFlows notifies n8n when processing completes
6. **Result Update**: n8n updates Directus file record with processed file URL and metadata

[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-4-media-file-processing-pipeline]

### Previous Story Context

**Story 4.1 (Directus CMS):**
- Directus deployed with PostgreSQL (directus_db) + Redis caching
- Local volume storage: `borgstack_directus_uploads`
- S3 migration template prepared for Story 5.1 SeaweedFS integration
- Webhook capabilities available in Directus admin panel
- Admin user and role management configured

**Story 4.2 (FileFlows Media Processing):**
- FileFlows deployed with 5 volumes: data, logs, temp, input, output
- Local volume storage until Story 5.1 SeaweedFS migration
- API endpoint: `/api/flow/trigger` for programmatic flow execution
- Example flows created in `config/fileflows/example-flows.json`:
  - Video H.264 transcode
  - Audio normalization
  - Image WebP conversion
- Processing node configured for local server
- Webhook capabilities for completion/error notifications

### Service Endpoints

**Directus API:**
- Base URL: `https://${DIRECTUS_HOST}`
- Health: `/server/health`
- Files API: `/items/directus_files`
- Webhooks: Settings → Webhooks in admin panel
- Authentication: Bearer token (from `DIRECTUS_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `DIRECTUS_ADMIN_PASSWORD`)

**FileFlows API:**
- Base URL: `https://${FILEFLOWS_HOST}`
- Flow Trigger: `/api/flow/trigger` (POST)
- Statistics: `/api/statistics` (GET)
- Authentication: Session-based (configured in FileFlows admin panel)

**n8n Workflow Platform:**
- Base URL: `https://${N8N_HOST}`
- Webhook endpoints: `/webhook/{webhook-name}` (POST)
- Example webhooks:
  - `/webhook/directus-upload` - Receives Directus file upload events
  - `/webhook/fileflows-complete` - Receives FileFlows completion events
  - `/webhook/fileflows-error` - Receives FileFlows error events
- Authentication: n8n admin credentials or API key

### n8n Workflow Integration Pattern

BorgStack uses **n8n as the central integration hub** for connecting services via HTTP/webhook patterns. Services do not communicate directly; all integration flows through n8n workflows.

[Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md]

**n8n Workflow Nodes:**
- **Webhook Trigger**: Receives events from Directus/FileFlows
- **HTTP Request**: Calls external service APIs (Directus REST API, FileFlows API)
- **Function**: Data transformation and mapping between services
- **IF**: Conditional logic for filtering and routing
- **Error Trigger**: Catch and handle API failures
- **Schedule Trigger**: Periodic monitoring and cleanup tasks

### Data Models and Payload Examples

**IMPORTANT:** The exact payload structures below are **proposed based on Directus Flow patterns and FileFlows webhook capabilities**. These will be verified and adjusted during implementation.

**Directus Flow Event Payload (Proposed):**
Based on Directus documentation patterns for Event Hook triggers:
```json
{
  "event": "files.upload",
  "key": "abc123-uuid",
  "collection": "directus_files",
  "payload": {
    "id": "abc123-uuid",
    "filename_download": "sample-video.mp4",
    "type": "video/mp4",
    "filesize": 15728640,
    "storage": "local",
    "uploaded_on": "2025-10-05T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```
[Based on: Directus Flow Event Hook trigger patterns]

**File Transfer Mechanism:**
FileFlows does NOT expose a REST API for triggering flows. Integration works by:
1. Copying file to FileFlows monitored `/input` directory
2. FileFlows auto-detects new files and processes them based on configured Flows
3. FileFlows sends webhook when processing completes (optional - configurable in FileFlows)

**FileFlows Completion Webhook Payload (Proposed):**
FileFlows webhook structure to be determined during Task 5 when configuring webhook in FileFlows UI. Expected fields based on FileFlows documentation:
```json
{
  "original_filename": "sample-video.mp4",
  "processed_filename": "sample-video-optimized.mp4",
  "output_path": "/output/sample-video-optimized.mp4",
  "status": "completed",
  "metadata": {
    "processing_time": 45,
    "codec": "h264",
    "resolution": "1920x1080"
  }
}
```
[Structure TBD - will be defined when configuring FileFlows webhook]

**Directus File Update Request:**
```json
{
  "description": "Processed by FileFlows on 2025-10-05",
  "processed_url": "{{output_file_url}}",
  "processing_status": "completed",
  "processing_metadata": {
    "original_size": 15728640,
    "processing_time": 45,
    "processed_by": "fileflows"
  }
}
```
[Based on: Directus REST API PATCH /items/directus_files/{id}]

### Error Handling Strategy

**Error Scenarios and Responses:**

[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#error-handling-scenarios]

**Scenario 1: FileFlows Processing Timeout**
- **Detection**: FileFlows processing exceeds 30 minutes without completion webhook
- **Response**:
  1. n8n scheduled workflow checks processing status every 5 minutes
  2. Query FileFlows API for job status
  3. If stuck: Cancel job via FileFlows API, mark Directus file as "failed"
  4. Send alert email to admin with file details
  5. Log error in n8n execution data

**Scenario 2: Invalid File Format**
- **Detection**: FileFlows returns error "Unsupported file format"
- **Response**:
  1. n8n receives error webhook from FileFlows
  2. Update Directus file `processing_status` to "failed"
  3. Add error message to `processing_metadata`: "Unsupported format"
  4. Send notification to user who uploaded file (optional)
  5. Do not retry (permanent failure)

**Scenario 3: Storage Full**
- **Detection**: FileFlows cannot write output file due to disk space
- **Response**:
  1. FileFlows returns error "Insufficient storage"
  2. n8n workflow catches error, triggers storage cleanup workflow
  3. Delete old processed files from `/output` (older than retention period)
  4. Retry processing once after cleanup
  5. If still fails: Alert admin to provision more storage

**Scenario 4: Directus API Failure (500)**
- **Detection**: Directus API returns 500 Internal Server Error when n8n tries to update file record
- **Response**:
  1. n8n workflow retry logic: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 20s)
  2. If all retries fail: Store update payload in n8n database for manual replay
  3. Send alert email to admin
  4. Continue workflow execution (don't block other files)
  5. Manual recovery: Admin reviews failed updates and replays via n8n UI

**Scenario 5: Webhook Delivery Failure**
- **Detection**: Directus webhook to n8n fails (n8n temporarily down)
- **Response**:
  1. Directus retries webhook delivery (built-in retry mechanism)
  2. If all retries fail: File uploaded but not processed
  3. n8n scheduled "Missed Files Detector" workflow runs every 30 minutes:
     - Query Directus for files with `processing_status` = "pending" older than 10 minutes
     - Manually trigger FileFlows processing for missed files
  4. Update file status to "processing"

### Storage Strategy

**Current State (Story 4.3):**
- Directus: Local volume `borgstack_directus_uploads` mounted at `/directus/uploads`
- FileFlows: Local volumes `borgstack_fileflows_input` (mounted at `/input`), `borgstack_fileflows_output` (mounted at `/output`)
- **File Transfer Mechanism:**
  - n8n container mounts both Directus and FileFlows volumes
  - n8n copies files between volumes using Execute Command node: `cp /directus/uploads/{file} /fileflows/input/{file}`
  - FileFlows auto-detects new files in `/input` directory and triggers processing
  - No direct API call to FileFlows - integration via filesystem monitoring

**Future State (Story 5.1 SeaweedFS Migration):**
- Directus: S3-compatible storage via SeaweedFS
- FileFlows: S3-compatible storage via SeaweedFS
- File transfer: Both services access shared SeaweedFS storage (no copying needed)
- Storage optimization: Single file stored in SeaweedFS, both services reference same object via S3 URLs

### Performance Considerations

**Media Processing Performance:**
- Video transcoding: ~0.5x realtime (2 minute video = 4 minutes processing)
- Image optimization: ~1-2 seconds per image
- Audio normalization: ~0.3x realtime

**Queue Management:**
- FileFlows queue depth: Monitor to prevent backlog
- Recommended: Max 10 concurrent processing jobs (based on 8 vCPU server)
- If queue exceeds 20 files: Alert admin to scale processing capacity

**Storage Optimization:**
- Delete original files after successful processing (configurable)
- Compression ratio: Video ~60% smaller, Images ~40% smaller (WebP)
- Expected savings: 40-50% total storage reduction

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#performance-testing]

### Coding Standards Compliance

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Testing

#### Testing Strategy
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

BorgStack testing focuses on **integration verification** rather than unit testing, since all services are pre-built Docker images.

**Testing Philosophy:**
- No unit tests: Services are pre-built containers
- Focus on integration: Verify services communicate correctly
- End-to-end validation: Test complete workflows from upload to processed result

#### Test File Location
```
tests/integration/test-directus-fileflows.sh
```
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

#### Test Coverage Requirements

**Integration Tests:**
1. **Webhook Connectivity**: Verify Directus can trigger n8n webhooks
2. **API Integration**: Verify n8n can call FileFlows API successfully
3. **File Processing**: Upload test file, verify FileFlows processes it
4. **Result Update**: Verify Directus file record updated with processed metadata
5. **Error Handling**: Test invalid file format, verify error workflow triggers
6. **Performance**: Measure processing time for sample files
7. **Storage**: Verify files in correct directories after processing
8. **Cleanup**: Verify optional original file deletion works
9. **Monitoring**: Verify metrics collection workflow runs successfully
10. **End-to-End**: Complete flow from upload to Directus update

**Test Execution:**
```bash
# Run integration test suite
./tests/integration/test-directus-fileflows.sh

# Expected output:
# ✅ Test 1: n8n workflows active
# ✅ Test 2: Directus webhook configured
# ✅ Test 3: File processing triggered
# ✅ Test 4: Directus updated with results
# ✅ Test 5: Error handling works
# ...
# PASS: 10/10 tests passed
```

#### Manual Testing Requirements

**Manual Verification Steps:**
1. Upload video file to Directus CMS
2. Monitor FileFlows UI to see processing job appear
3. Wait for processing to complete
4. Check Directus file record for updated `processed_url` and metadata
5. Verify processed file accessible and optimized
6. Test error case: Upload invalid file format, verify error notification

### Integration Workflow Sequence

**Detailed Step-by-Step Flow:**

1. **User uploads video.mp4 to Directus CMS** (via Directus admin UI)
2. **Directus creates file record** in `directus_files` collection with `processing_status: "pending"`
3. **Directus Flow triggers** (Event Hook on `files.upload` event for `directus_files` collection)
4. **Directus Flow filters** media files (Condition: `$trigger.payload.type` contains `video/`, `audio/`, or `image/`)
5. **Directus Flow sends webhook** to `https://${N8N_HOST}/webhook/directus-upload` with file metadata
6. **n8n receives webhook**, extracts file details (filename_disk, filename_download, type, size, id)
7. **n8n filters by media type** (IF node: only process video/*, audio/*, image/*)
8. **n8n copies file** from Directus uploads to FileFlows input:
   - Execute Command: `cp /directus/uploads/{filename_disk} /fileflows/input/{filename_download}`
   - Uses mounted volumes configured in docker-compose.yml
9. **FileFlows auto-detects new file** in `/input` directory (library monitoring - every 60 seconds)
10. **FileFlows matches file to Flow** (based on file extension and Flow configuration)
11. **FileFlows processes file**: Transcode to H.264, optimize bitrate, resize if needed
12. **FileFlows saves processed file** to `/output/{filename}-optimized.mp4`
13. **FileFlows sends completion webhook** to `https://${N8N_HOST}/webhook/fileflows-complete` with processing results (optional - if webhook configured)
14. **n8n receives completion event**, extracts processed file info
15. **n8n queries Directus API**: `GET /items/directus_files?filter[filename_download][_eq]={filename}`
16. **n8n updates Directus file record**: `PATCH /items/directus_files/{id}` with `{processed_url, processing_status: "completed", processing_metadata}`
17. **Directus saves updated record**, admin can now see processed file in CMS
18. **Optional: n8n cleanup workflow** deletes original file from `/input` directory (if `FILEFLOWS_DELETE_ORIGINALS=true`)

[Based on: Directus Flows event hooks + FileFlows directory monitoring + n8n workflow orchestration]

### Known Limitations

**Current Limitations (to be addressed in future stories):**

1. **Local Storage Only**: Files stored in local Docker volumes. SeaweedFS S3 migration in Story 5.1 will enable distributed storage and eliminate file copying between services.

2. **Single Processing Node**: FileFlows runs on single server. Horizontal scaling not configured (future enhancement).

3. **No Automatic Retry for Failed Jobs**: Failed processing jobs require manual intervention. Automatic retry mechanism could be added in future iteration.

4. **Basic Monitoring**: Performance metrics collected but no alerting thresholds configured. Advanced monitoring (Grafana/Prometheus) is post-MVP enhancement.

5. **Sequential Processing**: Files processed one at a time in queue. Batch processing optimization possible in future.

### Security Considerations

**Webhook Security:**
- n8n webhook endpoints are HTTPS-only (enforced by Caddy)
- Consider adding webhook signature validation (Directus supports HMAC signatures)
- n8n authentication required for workflow access

**File Access:**
- Directus files accessible only to authenticated users
- FileFlows processing runs in isolated container
- No direct file system access between services (mediated by n8n)

**API Authentication:**
- Directus API calls use Bearer token authentication
- FileFlows API uses session-based authentication
- Store credentials in n8n encrypted credential storage

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-05 (Updated: 2025-10-05 22:00)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

This integration story demonstrates **excellent architectural planning, comprehensive documentation, and strong security implementation**. The implementation follows a well-structured webhook-based event-driven pattern with n8n as the orchestration layer between Directus CMS and FileFlows media processing.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Excellent integration documentation with Mermaid sequence diagrams
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns across 5 n8n workflows (upload, complete, error, stats, missed-files)
- ✅ **Security hardened:** HMAC SHA-256 webhook signature validation implemented
- ✅ **Least privilege:** API token scoped to directus_files read/update only
- ✅ **Reliability:** Automatic retry mechanism via Missed Files Detector (30-min intervals)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with categorization logic
- ✅ Proactive performance monitoring (15-min intervals)
- ✅ Detailed manual task documentation with realistic time estimates (~100 min total)
- ✅ Bilingual configuration guides (Portuguese) with step-by-step instructions
- ✅ All 6 acceptance criteria have corresponding test coverage
- ✅ Proper coding standards compliance (volume naming, network isolation)

**Initial Issues → All Resolved:**
- ✅ **CORRECTED:** My initial review incorrectly flagged Execute Command node as invalid - it is a legitimate n8n node type
- ✅ **FIXED:** Webhook HMAC signature validation now implemented with timing-safe comparison
- ✅ **FIXED:** Scoped API token permissions documented (directus_files read/update only)
- ✅ **DELIVERED:** Missed Files Detector workflow created for automatic retry

### Improvements Implemented

**Security Enhancements:**

1. **HMAC Webhook Signature Validation** (`config/n8n/workflows/directus-fileflows-upload.json`)
   - Added signature validation node using SHA-256 HMAC
   - Timing-safe comparison to prevent timing attacks
   - Graceful fallback for development (skips validation if secret not set)
   - Logs and rejects invalid signatures with source IP tracking

2. **Scoped API Token Documentation** (`.env.example`, `config/n8n/workflows/README.md`)
   - Updated instructions for least-privilege permissions
   - Token limited to: directus_files collection, Read + Update only
   - Removed excessive "Full Access" requirement
   - Added DIRECTUS_WEBHOOK_SECRET environment variable

**Reliability Enhancements:**

3. **Missed Files Detector Workflow** (`config/n8n/workflows/missed-files-detector.json`)
   - Scheduled execution every 30 minutes
   - Queries Directus for files stuck in "pending" > 10 minutes
   - Automatically retries file copy to FileFlows
   - Updates file status with retry metadata
   - Recovers from webhook delivery failures without manual intervention

**Documentation Updates:**

4. **Configuration Guides Updated** (`config/n8n/workflows/README.md`, `docs/MANUAL_TASKS_4.3.md`)
   - Added Missed Files Detector workflow documentation
