## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 5.3 (Storage Integration Testing):**
[Source: docs/stories/5.3.storage-integration-testing.story.md#dev-agent-record]

- **Testing Philosophy**: Focus on deployment validation and integration verification (not unit tests)
- **Integration Test Pattern**: Bash scripts in `tests/integration/test-*.sh` with clear pass/fail output
- **CI/CD Pattern**: Add validation jobs to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for automated checks
- **Test Script Template**: Use standard bash test patterns with proper error handling
- **Test Independence**: Each test can run standalone, proper cleanup/teardown
- **QA Gate Process**: CONCERNS → fixes → PASS (comprehensive review required)

### Architecture Context

**Testing Strategy:**
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Philosophy:**
- **No unit tests**: Services are pre-built Docker images; upstream maintains their own tests
- **Focus on integration**: Verify services communicate correctly
- **Deployment validation**: Ensure clean deployment succeeds
- **Configuration verification**: Validate docker-compose.yml and .env correctness

**Testing Pyramid:**
```
                   E2E/Integration Tests
                   /                    \
          Deployment Validation    Service Integration
          /                                          \
   Configuration Tests                        API Connectivity Tests
```

**Performance Baselines (36GB RAM, 8 vCPU Server):**

| Metric | Target (p95) | Acceptable (p99) | Critical Threshold |
|--------|--------------|------------------|--------------------|
| **API Response Time** | < 200ms | < 500ms | > 1000ms |
| **Webhook Throughput** | 100 req/s | 50 req/s | < 25 req/s |
| **Database Connections** | < 150 concurrent | < 180 concurrent | > 200 (pool exhausted) |
| **Redis Operations** | > 10,000 ops/s | > 5,000 ops/s | < 1,000 ops/s |
| **Disk I/O (SSD)** | > 100 MB/s | > 50 MB/s | < 20 MB/s |
| **Memory Usage** | < 75% | < 85% | > 90% (swap risk) |
| **CPU Usage** | < 70% avg | < 85% avg | > 95% sustained |

### Core Workflows to Test

**Workflow 1: WhatsApp to Chatwoot Customer Service Integration**
[Source: docs/architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-1]

**Key Integration Points:**
- Evolution API receives WhatsApp message → webhooks to n8n at `/webhook/whatsapp-incoming`
- n8n queries Chatwoot API to find/create contact: `GET /api/v1/accounts/{id}/contacts`
- n8n creates conversation: `POST /api/v1/accounts/{id}/conversations`
- n8n posts message to Chatwoot: `POST /api/v1/accounts/{id}/conversations/{id}/messages`
- Chatwoot stores in PostgreSQL `chatwoot_db.messages` table
- Chatwoot queues notification in Redis (Sidekiq)
- Agent replies via Chatwoot UI → webhooks to n8n at `/webhook/chatwoot-message-created`
- n8n sends reply to Evolution API: `POST /message/sendText`
- Evolution API delivers message to WhatsApp

**Error Handling Scenarios to Test:**
1. Chatwoot API returns 500 error → n8n retries 3x with exponential backoff
2. Contact creation race condition → n8n catches 422 error, re-queries contact
3. Evolution API webhook delivery failure → Evolution retries 5x, n8n has backup poll mechanism
4. WhatsApp rate limit (429) → n8n waits per Retry-After header, retries once
5. Redis connection loss → Sidekiq jobs queued, processed when Redis recovers

**Workflow 2: Initial Deployment and Bootstrap**
[Source: docs/architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-2]

**Deployment Steps:**
1. System preparation: apt updates, Docker install
2. Environment variable generation: `.env` from `.env.example`
3. Validation: DNS, disk space (500GB), RAM (16GB minimum)
4. Image pull: All 14 service images (~15GB)
5. Service startup: Infrastructure first (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, SeaweedFS), then applications
6. Caddy SSL: Request Let's Encrypt certificates (HTTP-01 challenge)
7. Health check validation: All services respond with 200 OK
8. Total time: 4-6 hours per NFR1 requirement

**Workflow 3: Automated Backup Process**
[Source: docs/architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-3]

**Backup Components:**
- PostgreSQL dumps: n8n_db, chatwoot_db, directus_db, evolution_db (pg_dump)
- MongoDB dump: lowcoder database (mongodump)
- Volume snapshots: postgresql_data, redis_data, seaweedfs_*, n8n_data, evolution_instances, caddy_data
- Compression: zstd algorithm
- Encryption: AES-256 with passphrase
- Upload: To external storage (S3/B2/FTP)
- Retention: 7 daily, 4 weekly, 12 monthly, 5 yearly (configurable)
- Estimated size: ~50GB full backup
- Network transfer time: 30-120 minutes (bandwidth dependent)

**Workflow 4: Media File Processing Pipeline**
[Source: docs/architecture/core-workflows.md#workflow-4]

**Processing Flow:**
1. User uploads video to Directus via CMS UI
2. Directus stores file in `borgstack_directus_uploads` volume
3. Directus saves asset metadata in PostgreSQL `directus_db.assets` table
4. Directus triggers n8n webhook: `POST /webhook/directus-upload` with file metadata
5. n8n triggers FileFlows: `POST /api/flow/trigger` with filename and source path
6. FileFlows reads file from Directus upload volume
7. FileFlows detects format using FFprobe
8. FileFlows transcodes using FFmpeg: `-c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a aac`
9. FileFlows writes processed file to output directory
10. FileFlows webhooks n8n: `POST /webhook/fileflows-complete` with processed file metadata
11. n8n updates Directus asset: `PATCH /items/assets/{id}` with processed URL
12. Directus updates PostgreSQL record

### Testing Requirements

**Test Script Standards:**
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md, docs/stories/5.3.storage-integration-testing.story.md]

**Bash Testing Framework:**
- Use standard bash test patterns
- Each test outputs PASS/FAIL with descriptive messages
- Exit code 0 = all tests pass, Exit code 1 = at least one test failed
- Test independence (each test can run standalone)
- Proper cleanup/teardown to avoid side effects

**Integration Test Pattern:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# tests/integration/test-example.sh

set -e

echo "========================================"
echo "Example Integration Tests"
echo "========================================"

# Test 1: Example test
if docker compose ps example | grep -q "healthy"; then
  echo "✅ Test 1/N: Example test... PASS"
else
  echo "❌ Test 1/N: Example test... FAIL"
  exit 1
fi

# Test 2: Another test
RESULT=$(curl -s -f http://localhost:8080/health)
if [ "$RESULT" = "OK" ]; then
  echo "✅ Test 2/N: Another test... PASS"
else
  echo "❌ Test 2/N: Another test... FAIL"
  exit 1
fi

echo ""
echo "========================================"
echo "All tests passed!"
echo "========================================"
```

**Test Execution Order:**
1. Deployment verification tests (validate all services running)
2. Component integration tests (validate service-to-service communication)
3. End-to-end workflow tests (validate complete user journeys)
4. Failure scenario tests (validate error handling and resilience)

**Test Data Management:**
- Use test-specific data that can be safely created and deleted
- Clean up all test data after test execution
- Use predictable test identifiers (e.g., `test-contact-12345`)
- Document test data requirements and cleanup procedures

**CI/CD Integration:**
- Run deployment verification and component integration tests on every commit
- Run end-to-end workflow tests on PR and main branch
- Skip failure scenario tests in CI (destructive, run manually)
- Generate test reports as GitHub Actions artifacts
- Fail CI build if any critical tests fail

### Coding Standards Compliance

**Test Script Naming:**
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#naming-conventions]
- Use kebab-case: `test-e2e-workflows.sh`, `test-component-integration.sh`
- Prefix with `test-` for integration tests
- Prefix with `verify-` for deployment validation tests

**Shell Script Best Practices:**
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Enable strict mode: `set -e` (exit on error)
- Use descriptive variable names in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- Comment complex logic
- Make scripts executable: `chmod +x tests/integration/*.sh`

**Health Check Requirements:**
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-infrastructure-rules]
- All services must have health checks defined in docker-compose.yml
- Health checks must return quickly (< 5s timeout)
- Use `docker compose ps --format json | jq -r '.Health'` to verify health status

### Project Structure Alignment

**No Conflicts Detected:**

All file paths align with defined project structure:
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Deployment verification in `tests/deployment/`
- Test documentation in `docs/qa/` and `docs/08-testing.md`
- CI/CD in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Test runner script in `tests/run-all-tests.sh`

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Bash Testing Framework:**
- Use standard bash test patterns with clear output
- Exit code 0 = all tests pass, Exit code 1 = at least one test failed
- Test independence (each test can run standalone)
- Proper cleanup/teardown to avoid test data pollution

**Performance Testing Tools:**
- **wrk**: HTTP load testing for API endpoints (`sudo apt install wrk`)
- **ab (Apache Bench)**: Simple HTTP throughput testing (`sudo apt install apache2-utils`)
- **pgbench**: PostgreSQL performance benchmarking (included with PostgreSQL)
- **redis-benchmark**: Redis performance testing (included with Redis)
- **iostat**: Disk I/O performance monitoring (`sudo apt install sysstat`)
