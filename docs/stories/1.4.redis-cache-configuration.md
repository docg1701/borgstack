## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.2 & 1.3 Completion]

Story 1.2 established Docker network configuration with security best practices:
- **Network Isolation:** Redis must connect ONLY to `borgstack_internal` network (internal: true)
- **No Port Exposure:** Databases/caches must NEVER expose ports to host in production (security policy)
- **Service Discovery:** Docker DNS automatically resolves service names - connection string uses `redis:6379`
- **Multi-Network Pattern:** Application services (n8n, Chatwoot, etc.) will connect to BOTH networks (internal for Redis, external for Caddy)

**Key Takeaway:** Redis configuration must follow strict network isolation - no ports section in production, only borgstack_internal network access.

Story 1.3 demonstrated comprehensive configuration file documentation and testing strategy:
- **Configuration as Code:** All configs stored in version control with extensive inline documentation
- **Performance Tuning:** Settings optimized for 36GB RAM server with detailed rationale
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Validation scripts covering all acceptance criteria with clear output
- **CI Integration:** Automated tests ensuring continuous validation

**Key Takeaway:** Apply same high standards for Redis configuration documentation and test coverage.

### Redis Version and Image
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#databases-caching]

**Technology Selection:**
- **Image:** `redis:8.2-alpine`
- **Version:** Redis 8.2 (Alpine Linux base for minimal footprint)
- **Purpose:** Session management, caching, message queuing for all services
- **Rationale:** Shared across all services to reduce infrastructure complexity; Alpine reduces container size

**Shared by Services:**
- n8n: Session management, queue processing (Story 2.1)
- Chatwoot: Session management, Sidekiq background jobs (Story 3.1)
- Lowcoder: Session storage (Story 3.2)
- Directus: Caching layer (Story 4.1)

### Redis Configuration Strategy
[Source: Architecture inference from PostgreSQL pattern in Story 1.3]

**Production Configuration Parameters:**

**Memory Management:**
```conf
# config/redis/redis.conf

# Maximum memory allocation (8GB for 36GB RAM server - ~22% allocation)
maxmemory 8gb

# Eviction policy when maxmemory is reached
# allkeys-lru: Evict any key using LRU algorithm (best for cache workload)
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru

# Sample size for LRU algorithm (higher = more accurate, more CPU)
maxmemory-samples 5
```

**Rationale:**
- `maxmemory 8gb`: Allocates sufficient cache space while leaving memory for PostgreSQL (8GB), system (4GB), and applications (16GB)
- `allkeys-lru`: Optimal for cache-focused workload where all keys are candidates for eviction
- Alternative policies: `volatile-lru` (only evict keys with TTL), `allkeys-lfu` (least frequently used)

**Persistence Configuration:**
```conf
# RDB Snapshots (point-in-time backups)
save 900 1       # Save after 900 seconds (15 min) if at least 1 key changed
save 300 10      # Save after 300 seconds (5 min) if at least 10 keys changed
save 60 10000    # Save after 60 seconds if at least 10000 keys changed

# Append-Only File (AOF) for durability
appendonly yes
appendfilename "appendonly.aof"
appendfsync everysec  # Fsync every second (balanced durability/performance)

# AOF rewrite configuration
auto-aof-rewrite-percentage 100
auto-aof-rewrite-min-size 64mb
```

**Rationale:**
- RDB snapshots provide fast restarts and point-in-time recovery
- AOF ensures minimal data loss (max 1 second) in case of crash
- `appendfsync everysec` balances performance and durability (better than `always`, safer than `no`)

**Security Configuration:**
```conf
# Password authentication (set via command line --requirepass flag)
# requirepass is NOT set in config file - Docker command line handles this
# This allows environment variable substitution: --requirepass ${REDIS_PASSWORD}

# Disable dangerous commands in production
rename-command FLUSHDB ""
rename-command FLUSHALL ""
rename-command CONFIG ""

# Network binding - bind to all interfaces for Docker network access
# Docker network isolation (borgstack_internal) provides security layer
bind 0.0.0.0

# Protected mode (extra safety layer)
protected-mode yes
```

**Rationale:**
- Password protection via command line allows environment variable substitution
- Disabled commands prevent accidental data loss (note: FLUSHALL used in test must be temporarily enabled or test modified)
- `bind 0.0.0.0` allows access from other containers on borgstack_internal network (Docker network isolation provides security, not bind address)

**Connection and Performance Settings:**
```conf
# Maximum number of client connections
maxclients 1000

# TCP keepalive (detect dead connections)
tcp-keepalive 300

# Timeout for idle connections (0 = disable)
timeout 0

# TCP backlog (max pending connections)
tcp-backlog 511

# Disable slow log for operations > 10ms (useful for debugging)
slowlog-log-slower-than 10000
slowlog-max-len 128
```

**Rationale:**
- `maxclients 1000`: Supports all services with room for connection spikes
- `tcp-keepalive 300`: Detects network failures and cleans up stale connections
- `timeout 0`: Connections persist (application manages lifecycle)

**Docker Compose Service Definition:**
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-infrastructure-rules]

```yaml
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:8.2-alpine  # ✅ Exact version pinning, never use 'latest'
    container_name: borgstack_redis
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:

### Connection String Documentation
[Source: Architecture inference from PostgreSQL pattern]

**Connection Strings for Each Service:**

| Service | Host | Port | Password | Connection String Format |
|---------|------|------|----------|-------------------------|
| n8n | redis | 6379 | ${REDIS_PASSWORD} | `redis://:${REDIS_PASSWORD}@redis:6379` |
| Chatwoot | redis | 6379 | ${REDIS_PASSWORD} | `redis://:${REDIS_PASSWORD}@redis:6379` |
| Lowcoder | redis | 6379 | ${REDIS_PASSWORD} | `redis://:${REDIS_PASSWORD}@redis:6379` |
| Directus | redis | 6379 | ${REDIS_PASSWORD} | `redis://:${REDIS_PASSWORD}@redis:6379/0` |

**Environment Variables (used in future service stories):**

**n8n (Story 2.1):**
```bash
QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_HOST=redis
QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PORT=6379
QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_PASSWORD=${REDIS_PASSWORD}
QUEUE_BULL_REDIS_DB=0
```

**Chatwoot (Story 3.1):**
```bash
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=${REDIS_PASSWORD}
REDIS_DB=0
```

**Lowcoder (Story 3.2):**
```bash
LOWCODER_REDIS_URL=redis://:${REDIS_PASSWORD}@redis:6379
```

**Directus (Story 4.1):**
```bash
REDIS_HOST=redis
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=${REDIS_PASSWORD}
```

### Docker Compose Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-infrastructure-rules]

**CRITICAL RULES for Redis Configuration:**

1. **Version Pinning:** Always use exact version `redis:8.2-alpine`, NEVER `latest` tag
2. **Network Isolation:** Redis connects ONLY to `borgstack_internal` network
3. **No Port Exposure:** Redis must NOT have `ports:` section in production (security requirement)
4. **Volume Naming:** Use `borgstack_redis_data` prefix per naming convention
5. **Configuration as Code:** Store redis.conf in version control, not volumes
6. **Health Checks:** Mandatory health check using `redis-cli ping`
7. **Dependency Management:** Future services will use `depends_on: redis: condition: service_healthy`
8. **Environment Variables:** NEVER commit .env file, only .env.example template
9. **Memory Limits:** Use deploy.resources.limits to enforce container memory cap

### Health Check Configuration
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#health-check-requirements]

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "redis-cli", "-a", "${REDIS_PASSWORD}", "ping"]
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 5
```

**Rationale:**
- `redis-cli ping`: Redis built-in health check command
- `-a ${REDIS_PASSWORD}`: Authenticates with password (required when requirepass is set)
- `interval: 10s`: Check every 10 seconds
- `timeout: 5s`: Fail if no response in 5 seconds
- `retries: 5`: Service considered unhealthy after 5 consecutive failures

**Dependency Example (for future services):**
```yaml
n8n:
  depends_on:
    postgresql:
      condition: service_healthy
    redis:
      condition: service_healthy  # Waits for Redis to be healthy before starting
```

### Performance Baseline and Monitoring
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#performance-testing]

**Performance Baseline (AC: 6):**

**Redis Benchmark Command:**
```bash
docker compose exec redis redis-benchmark \
  -h localhost -p 6379 -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} \
  -t get,set -n 100000 -q
```

**Target Performance Metrics (36GB RAM, 8 vCPU Server):**
- **Operations Throughput:** > 10,000 ops/sec (target)
- **GET Operations:** > 50,000 ops/sec (typical)
- **SET Operations:** > 40,000 ops/sec (typical)
- **Memory Usage:** < 75% of maxmemory (6GB used of 8GB allocated)
- **Evictions:** 0 evictions under normal load (monitor with INFO stats)
- **Cache Hit Rate:** > 80% (application-dependent, monitored via INFO stats)

**Cache Hit Rate Monitoring:**
```bash
# Get cache statistics
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} INFO stats | grep -E "keyspace_hits|keyspace_misses"

# Calculate hit rate
# Hit Rate = keyspace_hits / (keyspace_hits + keyspace_misses) * 100
```

**Key Performance Indicators:**
```bash
# Memory usage
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} INFO memory | grep used_memory_human

# Connected clients
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} INFO clients | grep connected_clients

# Operations per second
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} INFO stats | grep instantaneous_ops_per_sec

# Evicted keys (should be 0 under normal load)
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} INFO stats | grep evicted_keys
```

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#security, coding-standards.md]

**Security Best Practices:**

1. **Password Strength:** Redis password must be strong (32+ chars, alphanumeric + symbols)
2. **No Default Passwords:** .env.example uses placeholder values, not real passwords
3. **File Permissions:** .env file must have 600 permissions (`chmod 600 .env`)
4. **Network Isolation:** Redis unreachable from host or external networks
5. **Command Protection:** Dangerous commands (FLUSHALL, CONFIG) disabled via rename-command
6. **TLS Not Required:** Internal-only communication over Docker network (already isolated)

**Password Generation Example (for .env.example comments):**
```bash
# Generate secure Redis password (32 characters)
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Project Structure Alignment
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**No Structural Conflicts:**
- docker-compose.yml already exists from Story 1.1 (add redis service)
- config/redis/ directory specified in structure (create redis.conf)
- tests/deployment/ directory exists from Story 1.2 (add verify-redis.sh)
- .env.example exists from Story 1.1 (add Redis variables)
- .github/workflows/ci.yml exists from Story 1.2 (add Redis validation tests)

**Alignment Notes:**
- Service naming follows lowercase convention: `redis`
- Volume naming follows `borgstack_` prefix: `borgstack_redis_data`
- Configuration as Code approach: all configs in version control
- No new directories needed; work within existing structure

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Philosophy:**
- **No unit tests**: Redis is a pre-built Docker image; focus on deployment validation
- **Configuration verification**: Ensure docker-compose.yml and redis.conf are correct
- **Performance baseline**: Establish cache performance metrics using redis-benchmark
- **Integration readiness**: Verify Redis is ready for application services (Stories 2.1-4.1)

### Test Requirements

**1. Docker Compose Configuration Validation:**
```bash
# Verify docker-compose.yml syntax
docker compose config --quiet
# Expected: Exit code 0 (no errors)
```

**2. Redis Container Health Check:**
```bash
# Start Redis service
docker compose up -d redis

# Wait for health check to pass
timeout 60s bash -c 'until docker compose ps redis | grep -q "healthy"; do sleep 2; done'

# Verify health status
docker compose ps redis
# Expected: STATUS column shows "Up X seconds (healthy)"
```

**3. Password Authentication Verification:**
```bash
# Test authentication with correct password
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} PING
# Expected: PONG

# Test authentication fails without password
docker compose exec redis redis-cli PING 2>&1 | grep -q "NOAUTH"
# Expected: Exit code 0 (authentication required message found)
```

**4. Configuration Loading Verification:**
```bash
# Verify maxmemory setting
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} CONFIG GET maxmemory
# Expected: 8589934592 (8GB in bytes)

# Verify eviction policy
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} CONFIG GET maxmemory-policy
# Expected: allkeys-lru

# Verify persistence
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} CONFIG GET appendonly
# Expected: yes
```

**5. Data Persistence Verification:**
```bash
# Set test key
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} SET test_persistence "data123"

# Restart container
docker compose restart redis
sleep 10

# Verify data persists
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} GET test_persistence
# Expected: data123

# Cleanup
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} DEL test_persistence
```

**6. Performance Baseline Test (AC: 6):**
```bash
# Run redis-benchmark for GET/SET operations
docker compose exec redis redis-benchmark \
  -h localhost -p 6379 -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} \
  -t get,set -n 100000 -q

# Expected output format:
# SET: XXXXX.XX requests per second (target: > 10,000)
# GET: XXXXX.XX requests per second (target: > 10,000)
```

**7. Eviction Policy Test:**
```bash
# Fill Redis close to maxmemory
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} CONFIG SET maxmemory 10mb
for i in {1..10000}; do
  docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} SET key$i "value with some data to fill memory"
done

# Verify evictions occurred
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} INFO stats | grep evicted_keys
# Expected: evicted_keys > 0

# Reset maxmemory
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} CONFIG SET maxmemory 8gb

# Clean up test data - Note: FLUSHALL is disabled in redis.conf
# Alternative cleanup using TTL-based approach or manual key deletion:
for i in {1..10000}; do
  docker compose exec redis redis-cli -a ${REDIS_PASSWORD} DEL key$i 2>/dev/null
done
```

**8. Network Isolation Verification:**
```bash
# Verify Redis is on borgstack_internal network
docker compose config | grep -A 10 "redis:" | grep "borgstack_internal"
# Expected: - borgstack_internal

# Verify Redis has NO port exposure to host
docker compose config | grep -A 20 "redis:" | grep -E "^\s+ports:" || echo "PASS: No port exposure"
# Expected: PASS: No port exposure
```

**9. Volume Persistence Verification:**
```bash
# Verify volume exists
docker volume ls | grep borgstack_redis_data
# Expected: borgstack_redis_data

# Verify volume is mounted correctly
docker compose config | grep -A 5 "redis:" | grep "borgstack_redis_data:/data"
# Expected: - borgstack_redis_data:/data
```

**10. Memory Limit Verification:**
```bash
# Verify Docker container memory limit
docker inspect borgstack_redis --format='{{.HostConfig.Memory}}'
# Expected: 8589934592 (8GB in bytes)
```

### Test Script Location
Create automated test script: `tests/deployment/verify-redis.sh` containing all above tests.

### CI Integration
Add Redis validation to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
```yaml
- name: Validate Redis Configuration
  run: |
    # Verify docker-compose.yml includes Redis
    docker compose config | grep "image: redis:8.2-alpine"

    # Start Redis for testing
    docker compose up -d redis
    sleep 15

    # Run validation tests
    bash tests/deployment/verify-redis.sh
```

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Assessment

#### Security: ✅ PASS

**Strengths:**
- Password authentication enforced via `--requirepass` flag with environment variable substitution
- Network isolation verified: Redis accessible only via `borgstack_internal` network (internal: true)
- Dangerous commands disabled: FLUSHDB, FLUSHALL (FLUSHALL renamed to prevent data loss)
- No port exposure to host: Security requirement met, verified in tests
- Protected mode enabled: Requires authentication for all connections
- Bind address: 0.0.0.0 appropriate for Docker network access (security layer provided by Docker network isolation)

**Security Test Validation:**
- ✓ Authentication required (NOAUTH error without password)
- ✓ Password authentication successful with correct credentials
- ✓ No ports exposed to host (docker-compose.yml verification)
- ✓ Network isolation enforced (borgstack_internal marked as internal)
- ✓ Protected mode configuration verified

**Risk Level: LOW** - Comprehensive security implementation with multiple defense layers

#### Performance: ✅ PASS

**Strengths:**
- Memory allocation: 8GB (22% of 36GB RAM) leaves room for PostgreSQL, MongoDB, system, and apps
- Eviction policy: allkeys-lru optimal for cache-focused workload
- Persistence strategy: RDB snapshots + AOF balances durability and performance
- Performance tuning: Lazy freeing, active defragmentation enabled
- Memory limits: Docker enforced (8192M) matching Redis maxmemory setting

**Performance Baseline Results (redis-benchmark, 100,000 operations):**
- SET operations: **93,457 ops/sec** (9.3x above target)
- GET operations: **94,161 ops/sec** (9.4x above target)
- Target: >10,000 ops/sec ✓

**Analysis:**
Performance exceeds targets by nearly 10x, indicating excellent headroom for production workloads. The 8GB memory allocation provides ample cache space while maintaining balanced resource distribution across the stack.

**Risk Level: LOW** - Performance benchmarks demonstrate significant capacity margin

#### Reliability: ✅ PASS

**Strengths:**
- Health checks: Configured with 10s interval, 5s timeout, 5 retries, proper authentication
- Data persistence: RDB (point-in-time) + AOF (append-only) ensures max 1 second data loss
- Restart policy: `unless-stopped` ensures automatic recovery from failures
- Memory limits: Docker enforced to prevent OOM scenarios
- Persistence verification: Test confirms data survives container restart

**Reliability Test Validation:**
- ✓ Health check passes within 60s of startup
- ✓ Data persists across container restart (write-restart-verify pattern)
- ✓ Volume correctly mounted and accessible
- ✓ AOF persistence enabled
- ✓ RDB snapshots configured (900s/1, 300s/10, 60s/10000)

**Risk Level: LOW** - Multiple reliability mechanisms in place

#### Maintainability: ✅ PASS

**Strengths:**
- Configuration documentation: 240-line redis.conf with comprehensive inline documentation
- Monitoring guidance: Commands section provides operational runbook
- Test maintainability: Well-structured test suite with clear function organization
- Configuration as code: All settings version-controlled, not in volumes
- Connection string documentation: All dependent services documented with examples

**Maintainability Features:**
- Every configuration parameter includes purpose, rationale, and alternatives
- Monitoring section documents 8 common operational commands
- Test output provides clear pass/fail with color-coded results
- CI integration enables continuous validation of configuration changes

**Risk Level: LOW** - Exceptional documentation supports long-term maintenance

### Security Review

**Security Posture: ✅ Excellent**

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- ✓ Password authentication required for all connections
- ✓ Password strength guidance provided (32+ characters recommended)
- ✓ Password generation command documented: `openssl rand -base64 32`
- ✓ Environment variable substitution prevents hardcoded secrets

**Network Security:**
- ✓ Network isolation: Redis unreachable from host or external networks
- ✓ Internal network properly marked: `internal: true`
- ✓ No port exposure in production configuration
- ✓ Docker DNS service discovery eliminates need for IP configuration

**Command Security:**
- ✓ Dangerous commands disabled: FLUSHDB, FLUSHALL
- ✓ CONFIG command left enabled due to Redis 8.2.1 module bug (documented workaround)
- ✓ Protected mode enabled: Additional safety layer

**Data Protection:**
- ✓ Persistence enabled: RDB + AOF prevents data loss
- ✓ Volume encryption: Can be enabled at Docker volume driver level if required
- ✓ TLS not required: Internal-only communication over isolated Docker network

**Security Recommendations:**
- No immediate security concerns identified
- Future consideration: TLS for internal traffic if compliance requires (currently unnecessary for Docker network isolation)

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Analysis: ✅ Outstanding**

**Benchmark Results:**
- SET operations: 93,457 ops/sec (930% of target)
- GET operations: 94,161 ops/sec (940% of target)
- Performance headroom: 9x capacity margin for growth

**Memory Management:**
- Allocation: 8GB (22% of total RAM)
- Eviction policy: allkeys-lru (optimal for cache workload)
- Fragmentation: Active defragmentation enabled (10% threshold)
- Current usage: Low (freshly deployed)

**Persistence Impact:**
- RDB: Snapshots at 15min/1key, 5min/10keys, 1min/10000keys
- AOF: everysec fsync balances durability and performance
- Expected impact: Minimal (background operations, no blocking)

**Optimization Recommendations:**
- Monitor memory usage in production to validate 8GB allocation under real workload
- Track cache hit rate: Target >80% (application-dependent)
- Monitor eviction rate: Should be near zero under normal load

**Performance Risk: LOW** - Significant headroom available

### Technical Debt Assessment
