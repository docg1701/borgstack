# Deployment Architecture

BorgStack uses a **single-server containerized deployment** model optimized for Brazilian businesses requiring data sovereignty and zero licensing costs.

## Deployment Strategy

**Frontend Deployment:**
- **Platform:** Self-hosted via Caddy reverse proxy
- **Build Command:** Not applicable (pre-built Docker images)
- **Output Directory:** Not applicable (containerized services)
- **CDN/Edge:** None (direct server access via HTTPS)
- **Access Pattern:** Users access service URLs directly (e.g., https://n8n.example.com.br)
- **Static Assets:** Each service serves its own static assets from container

**Backend Deployment:**
- **Platform:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS server (VPS, bare metal, or private cloud)
- **Build Command:** `docker compose pull` (downloads pre-built images)
- **Deployment Method:** Docker Compose orchestration
- **Deployment Directory:** `~/borgstack` (home directory of deployment user)
- **Container Registry:** Docker Hub (official images)
- **Scaling Strategy:** Vertical scaling (increase server resources) or horizontal for n8n/Chatwoot workers

**Infrastructure Deployment:**
- **Provisioning:** Manual server setup or bootstrap script automation
- **Configuration Management:** Environment variables + volume-mounted configs
- **Service Discovery:** Docker DNS (service names resolve automatically)
- **Load Balancing:** Not applicable (single server, Caddy routes by domain)
- **SSL/TLS:** Automatic via Caddy + Let's Encrypt
