2. **Documentation Phase**: Create Portuguese user guides (docs/01-installation.md through docs/08-performance.md)
3. **Testing Phase**: Implement integration tests and deployment validation scripts
4. **Pilot Deployment**: Deploy on staging server to validate 4-6 hour deployment target
5. **Documentation Validation**: Verify Portuguese documentation accuracy with target users
6. **Production Deployment**: Release v1.0 with comprehensive documentation
