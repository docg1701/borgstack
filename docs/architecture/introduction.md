# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **BorgStack**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for a Docker Compose-based infrastructure project where these concerns are tightly integrated.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield project**

BorgStack is a greenfield infrastructure project built from scratch. There are no starter templates being used. The architecture centers around a monorepo with `docker-compose.yml` as the centerpiece, integrating 13 open source components into a unified deployment stack.
